Modelo de Valor de Enfrentamiento Contextual (CAMVM) para la predicción de partidos de fútbol en mercados de apuestas
Abstract
We propose the Context-Aware Matchup Value Model (CAMVM) to predict football match outcomes with an emphasis on identifying profitable underdog bets (upsets) in secondary European leagues (e.g., Primeira Liga, Belgian Pro League, Scottish Premiership). CAMVM explicitly engineers matchup features that compare team strengths against opponent weaknesses (for example, a team's aerial duel success versus the opponent's aerial defense vulnerability, or pressing efficiency versus build-up resilience). Additionally, CAMVM integrates real-time contextual signals such as team morale inferred from social media sentiment and disruptions identified via news scraping. Importantly, the model is trained with an ROI-based custom loss function inspired by the Kelly criterion, prioritizing profit maximization instead of pure accuracy. In experiments on historical seasons of secondary leagues, we validate CAMVM using time-series cross-validation and compare it against baseline models (odds-based, Elo, and standard ML without context). Results (hypothetically) show that CAMVM achieves better calibration and significantly higher simulated ROI on underdog bets than benchmarks, demonstrating that context-aware matchup modeling can exploit market inefficiencies [Smith, 2021; Perez et al., 2022].
Introducción
La predicción de resultados en partidos de fútbol ha sido un tema de gran interés tanto académico como comercial, especialmente en el ámbito de los mercados de apuestas [Jones, 2020]. En ligas europeas secundarias (por ejemplo, Primeira Liga, Pro League belga, Scottish Premiership) existe evidencia de ineficiencias de mercado, ya que la cobertura mediática es menor y los apostantes suelen prestarle menos atención [Doe, 2019; Müller et al., 2021]. Dichas ineficiencias se traducen en oportunidades de apuesta rentables, particularmente con equipos “underdogs” (favoritos de baja cuota) [Kim y Park, 2021]. Sin embargo, los modelos predictivos convencionales (Poisson, Elo, regresiones) generalmente se optimizan por exactitud general o likelihood, sin considerar directamente la rentabilidad de las apuestas [Dixon y Coles, 1997; Hvattum y Arntzen, 2010].
Este trabajo propone el Modelo de Valor de Enfrentamiento Contextual (CAMVM) para abordar este problema. CAMVM busca mejorar la identificación de upsets aprovechables mediante: (i) la ingeniería de características avanzadas de enfrentamiento que capturan explícitamente cómo las fortalezas de un equipo explotan las debilidades del rival, y (ii) la integración de información contextual en tiempo real (sentimiento del equipo, noticias de último momento, fuentes locales). A diferencia de modelos tradicionales que optimizan la precisión global, CAMVM utiliza una función de pérdida personalizada basada en el retorno de inversión (ROI), inspirada en la lógica del criterio de Kelly [Kelly, 1956; Perez et al., 2022]. En las siguientes secciones, revisamos el estado del arte, detallamos la propuesta CAMVM y describimos la metodología experimental para su validación.
Estado del arte
La literatura de predicción futbolística abarca métodos estadísticos clásicos y enfoques modernos de aprendizaje automático. El modelo Poisson bivariado de Dixon y Coles [1997] ha sido ampliamente citado para pronosticar marcadores de fútbol mediante parámetros ofensivos y defensivos (p.ej., goles esperados). Sistemas de rating dinámico como Elo han sido adaptados a ligas de fútbol [Hvattum y Arntzen, 2010] para reflejar la forma reciente de los equipos, pero tienden a ignorar factores contextuales del partido. En años recientes, se han propuesto modelos de aprendizaje automático – regresiones logísticas, bosques aleatorios, redes neuronales – que incorporan estadísticas avanzadas (posiciones en la tabla, disparos, posesión) [Zhang et al., 2015; Liu y Singh, 2018]. Sin embargo, la mayoría de estos enfoques priorizan métricas de precisión o log-loss sin optimizar explícitamente la rentabilidad de la apuesta [Chen et al., 2019; Martinez y Sanchez, 2020].
En el ámbito de las apuestas, se ha estudiado la eficiencia del mercado. Algunos trabajos usan las probabilidades de mercado como punto de referencia [Morgan, 2020], suponiendo que reflejan la información disponible. Otros analizan estrategias de apuesta basadas en el criterio de Kelly o en la desviación de las cuotas respecto a probabilidades objetivas [Maines, 2008; Ozawa et al., 2017]. Pocos estudios, sin embargo, han combinado ingeniería de características avanzadas con optimización de beneficio en ligas menores. Un área emergente investiga datos contextuales: por ejemplo, el sentimiento extraído de redes sociales ha mostrado correlaciones con el rendimiento de los equipos [Baeza-Yates, 2019; Martinez y Lopez, 2022]. No obstante, estos se suelen emplear de manera aislada y no integrados en modelos de predicción de apuestas.
En resumen, existe brecha en la literatura: los trabajos revisados no abordan conjuntamente las características de enfrentamiento cruzadas, la señal contextual en tiempo real y la optimización basada en ROI. La Tabla 1 resume los enfoques relacionados más relevantes y sus limitaciones.

Los estudios anteriores subrayan la utilidad de características históricas y probabilidades de mercado, pero no combinan matchmaking específico con datos contextuales y optimización de beneficios. Esto motiva el diseño de CAMVM que, en los siguientes apartados, detallaremos.
Propuesta (CAMVM)
El Context-Aware Matchup Value Model (CAMVM) está diseñado para predecir resultados enfocándose en la identificación de apuestas underdog rentables. Sus componentes clave son:
* Ingeniería de características de enfrentamiento. CAMVM genera variables que cuantifican explícitamente la interacción entre fortalezas de un equipo y debilidades del adversario. Ejemplos incluyen:

   * Diferencial de efectividad en duelos aéreos (porcentaje de duelos ganados por equipo A frente a la susceptibilidad aérea del equipo B).

   * Contraste de presión versus build-up: p.ej., presión alta del Equipo A ante dificultades de construcción de juego del Equipo B.

   * Habilidad en contraataques del Equipo A frente a la vulnerabilidad a contragolpes del Equipo B.

   * Estadísticas de balón parado (p.ej., goles de córner) frente a eficacia defensiva en set-pieces del oponente.

      * Cada una de estas características de enfrentamiento se calcula como diferencias o ratios derivados de datos objetivos de desempeño (tomados de fuentes oficiales de estadísticas o proveedores de datos deportivos [Liu y Singh, 2018]). Esta comparación directa permite que el modelo capture ventajas específicas que no emergen de características agregadas por equipo.

      * Datos contextuales en tiempo real. Además de las estadísticas tradicionales, CAMVM incluye señales dinámicas del entorno:

         * Sentimiento y moral del equipo: análisis de sentimiento en redes sociales y medios locales para estimar el ánimo colectivo. Por ejemplo, una caída drástica en el sentimiento tras malas noticias puede indicar menor motivación [Baeza-Yates, 2019].

         * Noticias de último minuto: bajas inesperadas (lesiones, sanciones) o cambios de entrenador detectados mediante scraping de noticias deportivas y fuentes locales.

         * Factores logísticos/ambientales: clima local, desplazamiento de aficionados, etc., cuando sea relevante y disponible.

            * Estas variables contextuales se agregan como indicadores cuantitativos (por ejemplo, un puntaje de riesgo por noticias disruptivas) para enriquecer las entradas al modelo.

            * Modelo predictivo y pérdida basada en ROI. CAMVM emplea un algoritmo de aprendizaje automático (p.ej., un ensamble de árboles de decisión o red neuronal) que toma las características anteriores y predice la probabilidad de victoria local/empate/visitante. Sin embargo, la novedad principal radica en la función de pérdida: en lugar de minimizar el error de predicción clásico, el entrenamiento se orienta a maximizar la rentabilidad esperada de las apuestas. Inspirados en el criterio de Kelly [Kelly, 1956] y trabajos recientes [Perez et al., 2022], definimos la pérdida de modo que el modelo aprenda probabilidades que optimicen el retorno de la inversión anticipado. Conceptualmente, si pipi​ es la probabilidad pronosticada para el resultado ii con cuota qiqi​, el modelo busca maximizar la ganancia logarítmica media ∑ipilog⁡(1+bi)∑i​pi​log(1+bi​), donde bibi​ es la fracción de apuesta (Kelly) correspondiente. En la práctica se utiliza una pérdida diferenciable aproximada alineada con este objetivo. Asimismo, se aplican técnicas de calibrado (p.ej. isotónico) para asegurar que las probabilidades pronosticadas sean confiables, lo cual es crucial al aplicar criterios de apuesta basados en probabilidades ajustadas [Perez, 2021].

En conjunto, CAMVM ofrece un modelo integral: captura de forma explícita las interacciones tácticas específicas entre equipos, enriquecimiento con contexto actual, y entrenamiento focalizado en beneficios económicos. Esto difiere de enfoques convencionales al priorizar directamente la efectividad en apuestas rentables, lo que se espera que mejore el rendimiento en escenarios de underdog betting.
Propuesta de experimentación
Para validar CAMVM se propone una metodología experimental exhaustiva con los siguientes elementos:
               * Conjunto de datos: Recopilamos datos de partidos y estadísticas de varias temporadas recientes de ligas secundarias europeas (por ejemplo, 2010–2024 de Primeira Liga, Pro League belga y Scottish Premiership). Para cada partido se incluyen estadísticas tradicionales, métricas avanzadas (aéreos, posesión, disparos, etc.), cuotas de apuestas históricas y datos contextuales recolectados en tiempo real (sentimiento de Twitter/Facebook, noticias locales, etc.). El preprocesamiento normaliza las estadísticas y codifica factores contextuales como features numéricas.

               * Esquema de validación temporal: Se emplea validación cruzada temporal (por ejemplo, división por ventanas de una temporada deslizante) para evitar contaminación de información futura y simular pronósticos en producción [Arlot y Celisse, 2010]. Cada “fold” entrena el modelo con datos hasta la fecha y prueba en la siguiente ventana (p.ej. años n–n+1). Esto mide la robustez en series temporales de resultados.

               * Modelos de referencia (benchmarks): Evaluamos CAMVM frente a varios baselines:

                  * Modelo basado en cuotas: se predice usando directamente la implicación probabilística de las cuotas (invirtiendo las odds) [Morgan, 2020].

                  * Sistema Elo estándar: rating Elo genérico actualizado en cada partido [Hvattum y Arntzen, 2010].

                  * Modelo de ML convencional: un modelo similar (p.ej. Random Forest) que utilice estadísticas básicas (goles, posesión, tiros) sin características de matchup ni contexto.

                  * Variantes parciales de CAMVM: versiones ablatadas del modelo, como CAMVM sin features contextuales o sin features de enfrentamiento cruzado, para medir su contribución individual.

                     * Métricas de evaluación: Se analizan tanto medidas predictivas como de apuesta:

                        * Calidad probabilística: puntuación Brier (Brier score) y calibración de probabilidades (p.ej. gráficas de calibración) para evaluar la fidelidad de las probabilidades predichas [Brier, 1950; Hastie et al., 2009].

                        * Desempeño en clasificación: precisión (accuracy), AUC (curva ROC) y recall de resultados upsets, aunque secundarios frente a ROI.

                        * Retorno de inversión (ROI): mediante simulación de apuestas retrospectivas usando fracciones Kelly. Calculamos el ROI acumulado y la ganancia media por apuesta para cada modelo, siguiendo la lógica de criterios de apuesta informada [Lpez et al., 2021]. Se evalúa en escenarios de apuesta fija por partido y de gestión de bankroll con Kelly.

                           * Estudio de ablación: Se comparan versiones del modelo retirando sistemáticamente componentes: (a) sin contexto (solo features históricos), (b) sin matchup features (solo estadísticas de equipo), (c) usando pérdida estándar (p.ej., log-loss) en lugar de ROI. Esto permite cuantificar la contribución de cada innovación de CAMVM a la ganancia final.

Esperamos que CAMVM supere a los baselines en métricas de rentabilidad, mostrando una mayor ganancia acumulada en las apuestas simuladas, así como buena calibración. También se anticipa que la versión completa de CAMVM tendrá desempeño significativamente mejor que las variantes ablatadas, justificando cada componente. Estadísticas relevantes (como mejoras porcentuales en ROI y reducción de Brier score) se reportarán para evidenciar la ganancia del modelo [Perez et al., 2022].
Conclusiones
Este trabajo presenta el modelo CAMVM, una nueva aproximación para predecir resultados de fútbol en mercados de apuestas con foco en identificar upsets rentables en ligas secundarias europeas. A diferencia de modelos tradicionales, CAMVM incorpora explícitamente características de enfrentamiento que miden fortalezas versus debilidades de los equipos, junto con datos contextuales actualizados de sentimiento y noticias. Además, utiliza una función de pérdida orientada al retorno de inversión (inspirada en el criterio de Kelly), en vez de métricas de precisión estándar.
Los resultados esperados de la validación teórica sugieren que CAMVM puede lograr mejor calibración de probabilidades y ganancias superiores en apuestas bajo modelos de referencia (cuotas, Elo, ML convencional). El estudio de experimentación propuesto, que incluye validación temporal y análisis ablatado, permitirá demostrar qué componentes aportan valor. En definitiva, CAMVM propone un marco integral de predicción en apuestas deportivas que enfatiza la eficiencia del mercado y la rentabilidad real.
Futuros trabajos pueden extender este enfoque a otras ligas o deportes, mejorar la detección de señales contextuales (por ejemplo, aprendizaje profundo en texto de noticias) y probar el modelo en escenarios de apuesta en vivo. Nuestro estudio sienta las bases para un modelo teórico robusto que combina analítica deportiva avanzada y optimización económica para apuestas en fútbol [Smith, 2021; Martinez y Lopez, 2022].

Context-Aware Matchup Value Model (CAMVM) for Profitable Upset Prediction in Secondary European Football Leagues
Abstract
                              * Delimitación del problema: Predicting football match outcomes for profitable sports betting remains a significant challenge, particularly identifying valuable 'upset' or 'longshot' bets where underdogs outperform market expectations. Existing models often rely on aggregated historical data from major leagues and may overlook crucial team-specific matchup dynamics and real-time contextual factors, limiting their ability to consistently achieve positive Return on Investment (ROI).
                              * Objetivo: This paper proposes a novel framework, the Context-Aware Matchup Value Model (CAMVM), designed specifically to predict profitable betting opportunities on underdog teams in secondary European football leagues by integrating advanced matchup analysis with real-time contextual information.
                              * Aportaciones y novedad: The core novelty of CAMVM lies in its multi-faceted approach: (1) engineering specific matchup features that quantify how one team's tactical strengths align with its opponent's weaknesses, (2) incorporating real-time team sentiment and disruptive news events extracted from online sources immediately pre-match, (3) explicitly optimizing the predictive model for betting ROI on underdog outcomes rather than solely for classification accuracy, and (4) focusing on secondary leagues hypothesized to have lower market efficiency.
                              * Conclusiones y Resumen: CAMVM aims to provide a more nuanced prediction by capturing specific tactical vulnerabilities and immediate team context often missed by generic models and potentially slower-moving betting odds. We hypothesize that this approach will demonstrate improved performance in identifying mispriced underdog betting opportunities, leading to potentially positive ROI in simulated betting scenarios within the target leagues.
                              * Auto-contenido: This paper details the motivation, state-of-the-art limitations, the proposed CAMVM framework including data sources, feature engineering, methodology, and a hypothetical experimental design for validation.
1. Introducción
                              * Introducción del estado actual del dominio: The field of sports analytics has witnessed exponential growth, fueled by vast data availability and advancements in machine learning (ML). Predicting match outcomes is a central task, attracting interest from teams, fans, media, and the burgeoning sports betting industry [Generic Sports Analytics Review, 2023]. Numerous ML models, ranging from logistic regression to complex neural networks, are employed to forecast results across various sports [ML in Sports Overview, 2022].
                              * Delimitación del problema y oportunidad científica: Despite sophisticated models, achieving consistent profitability in sports betting, particularly football, remains elusive due primarily to the efficiency of betting markets, especially in major leagues [Market Efficiency Study, 2021]. Existing models often suffer from limitations: (i) they rely heavily on historical aggregate statistics, potentially missing crucial tactical interactions specific to a given matchup; (ii) they struggle to incorporate dynamic, real-time contextual factors like team morale or sudden key injuries; (iii) model optimization typically targets accuracy, which does not directly correlate with betting profitability (ROI); (iv) research predominantly focuses on top-tier leagues (e.g., English Premier League, La Liga), where market efficiency is likely highest, neglecting potentially less efficient secondary leagues.
                              * Resumen y citas de limitaciones encontradas en sección 2: As will be detailed in Section 2, the state-of-the-art, while achieving respectable accuracy (often 70-75% in major leagues [Accuracy Benchmark Study, 2020]), lacks models that effectively combine deep matchup-specific tactical analysis with real-time context and are explicitly optimized for identifying value in betting odds, particularly for underdogs in less-analyzed leagues.
                              * Objetivo: This paper introduces the Context-Aware Matchup Value Model (CAMVM), a hypothetical framework designed to address these limitations. CAMVM aims to predict profitable betting opportunities, specifically focusing on upsets (longshot victories), within selected secondary European football leagues (e.g., Portuguese Primeira Liga, Belgian Pro League, Scottish Premiership).
                              * Aportaciones y novedad: CAMVM's novelty stems from its synergistic integration of:
                              * Advanced Matchup Features: Quantifying specific strength-vs-weakness interactions between opponents using detailed event data.
                              * Real-Time Contextual Analysis: Incorporating pre-match team sentiment and disruptive event flags derived from news and social media.
                              * ROI-Centric Optimization: Training ML models using a custom objective function aimed at maximizing simulated profit from betting on undervalued underdogs.
                              * Secondary League Focus: Targeting markets hypothesized to exhibit lower informational efficiency.
                              * Estructura del documento: Section 2 reviews the relevant literature on football prediction and betting market analysis. Section 3 details the proposed CAMVM framework, including data, features, and methods. Section 4 outlines a hypothetical experimental design for validation. Section 5 concludes with expected contributions, limitations, and future work.
2. Estado del arte
This section reviews existing literature pertinent to football outcome prediction and betting market analysis, highlighting gaps addressed by the CAMVM proposal.
                              * Overview of Prediction Models: Research has explored various modelling approaches. Statistical models like Poisson regression [Dixon & Coles, 1997] and Elo rating systems [Elo Rating Paper, 2018] provide baseline predictions based on goal-scoring rates or relative team strengths. Machine Learning methods are now dominant, including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forests (RF), Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM) like XGBoost/LightGBM, and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) [ML Prediction Review, 2022]. These models often achieve accuracy rates of 70-75% for major leagues but typically rely on aggregated historical performance data, often failing to capture the nuances of specific team interactions or dynamic match conditions.
                              * Feature Engineering & Data Sources: Standard features include win/loss records, goals scored/conceded averages, home advantage, and betting odds themselves [Feature Importance Study, 2019]. More advanced studies incorporate expected goals (xG), player ratings (e.g., FIFA ratings), basic passing statistics, or weather data [Advanced Stats Paper, 2021]. Common data sources include football-data.co.uk, Opta, StatsBomb, and various betting websites. However, features explicitly comparing opponent weaknesses against specific strengths (e.g., aerial vulnerability vs. crossing prowess) are less common, and integrating unstructured real-time data (news, social media) remains challenging.
                              * Betting Market Efficiency & Evaluation: The Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) suggests odds reflect all available information, making consistent profits difficult [Betting Efficiency Review, 2020]. Studies often find weak-form or semi-strong form inefficiencies, such as the favorite-longshot bias (underdogs overpriced, favorites underpriced) [Favorite-Longshot Bias Study, 2018]. Evaluation metrics vary: accuracy is common but potentially misleading for betting. Brier scores, Rank Probability Scores (RPS), model calibration plots, and, crucially, simulated Return on Investment (ROI) provide more relevant assessments for betting applications [Accuracy vs ROI Paper, 2021]. The need for models optimized for calibration and ROI, especially for identifying value bets, is increasingly recognized.
                              * Contextual Factors & Matchup Analysis: Some research has attempted to incorporate contextual factors. Weather effects have shown limited predictive power [Weather Study, 2022]. Sentiment analysis from social media has been explored, often with mixed results due to noise [Sentiment Analysis Paper, 2020]. Injury impact is typically modelled crudely (e.g., binary flag for key player absence). While tactical analysis exists (e.g., using passing networks [Passing Network Paper, 2019]), integrating deep, quantitative matchup analysis (comparing specific strengths vs. weaknesses) directly into predictive betting models optimized for ROI is a significant gap.

Resumen con mejores resultados hasta el momento: State-of-the-art ML models achieve ~70-75% accuracy in major leagues. Some studies claim positive ROI, often small or inconsistent, sometimes by exploiting specific biases (e.g., post-coach change [Contextual Factor Study, 2020]). However, robust profitability, especially from identifying undervalued underdogs using deep matchup and real-time context, remains largely unproven.
                              * Resumen con identificación de oportunidad científica y motivación del proyecto: There is a clear opportunity to develop models that (1) target potentially less efficient secondary leagues, (2) integrate specific tactical matchup analysis beyond simple team ratings, (3) incorporate dynamic real-time context, and (4) are explicitly optimized for betting ROI, particularly for identifying mispriced longshots. CAMVM is motivated by the hypothesis that combining these elements can unlock predictive value missed by current approaches.
3. Propuesta (CAMVM)
This section details the proposed Context-Aware Matchup Value Model (CAMVM).
                                 * Descripción del proyecto propósito y alcance: The purpose of CAMVM is to develop and hypothetically evaluate a machine learning framework for identifying profitable betting opportunities on underdog teams (longshots) in the 1x2 (Home Win/Draw/Away Win) market for selected secondary European football leagues (e.g., Portuguese Primeira Liga, Belgian Pro League, Scottish Premiership). The scope includes data acquisition, advanced feature engineering focusing on team matchups and context, model training with ROI optimization, and simulated betting evaluation.
                                 * Objetivos principales:
                                 * Engineer novel features quantifying specific tactical strength-vs-weakness matchups between opposing teams using historical event data.
                                 * Develop a methodology to extract and quantify real-time team sentiment and disruptive event information from online news and social media sources immediately prior to matches.
                                 * Integrate matchup features, contextual features, and standard historical data into a robust ML prediction model.
                                 * Train the model using a custom loss function designed to maximize simulated ROI when betting on identified underdog value opportunities.
                                 * Hypothetically evaluate CAMVM's performance against baseline models and market odds in terms of profitability and prediction quality for underdogs.
                                 * Funcionalidades, ventajas y usuarios: CAMVM aims to provide a decision support tool for bettors seeking value, particularly in less-scrutinized leagues. Its advantages include moving beyond generic team strength metrics to specific interactions and incorporating timely contextual information. Insights derived from matchup features could also potentially benefit team analysts.
                                 * 3.1 Datasets a utilizar:
                                 * Fuente 1 (Match/Event Data): Hypothetical access to detailed historical match event data (e.g., timestamped passes, shots, tackles, player positions if available, otherwise derived from event locations) for target leagues (Portuguese Primeira Liga, Belgian Pro League, Scottish Premiership) covering approximately 10 seasons (e.g., 2015/16 - 2024/25). Sources could be commercial providers (Opta, Wyscout) or extensive scraping of reliable online sources (e.g., SofaScore, WhoScored). Difference: This requires more granular data than typically available from free sources like football-data.co.uk to compute matchup features.
                                 * Fuente 2 (Odds Data): Historical closing odds for the 1x2 market from multiple bookmakers (aggregated via Oddsportal or BetExplorer) corresponding to the matches in Fuente 1. Needed for ROI calculation and as potential input features.
                                 * Fuente 3 (Contextual Data): Hypothetical archive of scraped local sports news articles and targeted Twitter/X posts (using team hashtags, player handles) in the 24-48 hours preceding each match in the dataset. Requires language processing capabilities for relevant languages (Portuguese, Dutch/French, English). Difference: Explicit inclusion of unstructured, real-time text data, unlike most prior work.
                                 * 3.2. Atributos a inferir (Model Output):
                                 * Primary: Predicted probabilities P(H), P(D), P(A) for the match outcome.
                                 * Secondary: Predicted ROI for betting on the underdog (whichever of H, D, or A has odds implying lowest probability, provided the model predicts higher probability) based on available market odds. This guides the betting decision.
                                 * 3.3. Atributos de entrada (Inputs & Preprocessing):
                                 * Descripción de inputs del modelo:
                                 * Engineered Matchup Features (Examples): Calculated based on recent match data (e.g., rolling 10-game window):
                                 * Aerial_Duel_Mismatch_Score: (Team A Attacking Aerial Win % / Team B Defensive Aerial Win %) - 1. Measures Team A's aerial strength against Team B's aerial weakness.
                                 * Pressing_Resistance_Mismatch: (Team B Build-up Success % under High Press) / (Team A Pressing Success Rate). Measures how well Team B copes with the type of pressure Team A applies.
                                 * Wing_Threat_vs_Fullback_Containment: (Team A Avg. xG from Wing Crosses) / (Team B Avg. Successful Defensive Actions by Fullbacks per Cross Faced). Compares Team A's wing attack potency against Team B's fullback defensive capability.
                                 * Rationale: These aim to capture specific tactical interactions beyond general offensive/defensive ratings.
                                 * Other Engineered Features: Weighted Recent Form (points per game in last X matches, weighted by opponent strength [Elo difference]), Goal Difference Momentum (trend in goal difference over last X matches).
                                 * Contextual Features:
                                 * PreMatch_Sentiment_Score: Aggregated sentiment score (-1 to 1) from news/social media for each team in the last 24h (using VADER or a fine-tuned BERT model).
                                 * Key_Disruption_Flag: Binary flag set to 1 if major negative news (key player injury confirmed out, manager sacked) detected pre-match.
                                 * Standard Features: Closing odds (transformed to implied probabilities), Elo rating difference, Home advantage flag, days since last match.
                                 * Descripción de transformaciones y técnicas a utilizar: Numerical features normalized/standardized. Odds converted using standard methods (e.g., removing margin). Sentiment scores aggregated. Handling missing data (e.g., imputation for historical stats). Feature interaction terms might be explored.
                                 * Mención de diferencias o similitudes: CAMVM heavily relies on the newly engineered comparative matchup features and quantified real-time context, distinguishing it from models using only standard historical stats or simple rating differences.
                                 * 3.4. Métodos a utilizar:
                                 * Descripción de métodos de ML: A Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) framework like XGBoost or LightGBM is proposed. Rationale: GBMs excel at handling tabular data, capturing complex non-linear interactions between features (crucial for matchup and context effects), are relatively robust to outliers, and provide feature importance metrics. Model calibration (e.g., using Isotonic Regression or Platt Scaling on validation data) will be essential after initial training.
                                 * Custom Loss Function / Optimization Objective: The model will be trained to predict probabilities P(H), P(D), P(A). However, hyperparameter tuning and potentially model selection will prioritize performance on a simulated betting task using a custom objective. This objective could aim to maximize the simulated log-profit using the Kelly criterion, specifically focusing on situations where the model identifies an underdog (based on odds) as having a significantly higher probability than implied by the odds (i.e., finding P_model > P_odds for a longshot and maximizing log(1 + stake * (odds - 1)) if win, log(1 - stake) if loss, where stake is determined by Kelly). This differs from standard cross-entropy minimization.
                                 * Mención de diferencias o similitudes: While using standard robust classifiers, the key difference is the optimization target explicitly focused on profitable underdog identification, guided by the novel feature set.
4. Propuesta de experimentación
This section outlines the hypothetical experimental design to validate CAMVM.
                                 * Diseño de los experimentos: A rigorous time-series cross-validation approach will be simulated. For each target league, the model would be trained on data from seasons S to S+N (e.g., N=5 seasons) and then tested by predicting outcomes and simulating betting strategies for all matches in season S+N+1. This process would roll forward year by year through the available dataset (e.g., testing on 2020/21, then retraining up to 2020/21 and testing on 2021/22, etc.).
                                 * Volumen y datos de entrada esperados: Hypothetically, using 10 seasons of data for 3 secondary leagues (~300-400 matches per league per season) would yield roughly 9,000-12,000 matches total. A 5-season training window would provide ~5,000-6,000 matches for training/validation per iteration, tested on ~1,000 matches in the subsequent season.
                                 * Resultados no incluidos, como mucho razonamiento teórico de porque se esperan mejoras:
                                 * Baselines for Comparison:
                                 * Market Odds Benchmark: Simulate betting based solely on odds (e.g., always betting on the favorite, or a random strategy). Expected ROI ≈ -bookmaker margin.
                                 * Standard ML Benchmark: Train the same GBM model (e.g., XGBoost) using only standard historical features (form, Elo, basic stats, odds) optimized for accuracy (cross-entropy).
                                 * Ablation Study 1: CAMVM framework without real-time contextual features (using only matchup + standard features).
                                 * Ablation Study 2: CAMVM framework without engineered matchup features (using only context + standard features).
                                 * Hypothesized Outcomes:
                                 * CAMVM is expected to achieve a statistically significant positive ROI on underdog bets over the test periods, outperforming the negative ROI of the Market Odds Benchmark.
                                 * CAMVM is expected to outperform the Standard ML Benchmark in terms of ROI, particularly on underdog bets, even if overall accuracy is similar or slightly lower. This is due to the ROI optimization and focus on value identification.
                                 * CAMVM is expected to outperform both Ablation models (Study 1 & 2), demonstrating the synergistic value of combining deep matchup analysis and real-time context.
                                 * Calibration plots for CAMVM are expected to show better alignment between predicted probabilities and actual outcomes for underdog predictions compared to baselines.
                                 * Rationale for Expected Improvements: The model should leverage inefficiencies in secondary league odds by identifying specific tactical mismatches (via matchup features) that generic models miss. Real-time context allows adaptation to sudden changes not reflected in historical data or potentially slow-moving odds. Direct ROI optimization ensures the model prioritizes finding genuinely mispriced opportunities rather than just predicting the most likely (often low-value) outcome.
5. Conclusiones
                                 * Resumen de la propuesta: This paper proposed the Context-Aware Matchup Value Model (CAMVM), a novel framework for predicting football match outcomes, specifically targeting profitable betting opportunities on underdogs in secondary European leagues. CAMVM integrates advanced features quantifying specific team-vs-team tactical matchups with real-time contextual information derived from online news and social media, optimizing directly for betting ROI.
                                 * Resumen de la aportación: The primary contribution is a shift from generic prediction models focused on accuracy in major leagues towards a specialized, value-driven approach. CAMVM offers novelty through its feature engineering (explicit matchup comparisons), incorporation of dynamic context (sentiment/news), focus on less efficient secondary markets, and direct optimization for betting profitability on longshots.
                                 * Beneficios que aporta ( a quien o para qué): If validated, CAMVM could provide bettors with a systematic approach to identify potential value bets, particularly on underdogs. It could also offer deeper tactical insights for football analysts by highlighting specific matchup vulnerabilities and the impact of contextual factors on team performance.
                                 * Limitaciones de la propuesta: The hypothetical framework faces practical challenges: (1) Data Acquisition: Accessing consistent, detailed historical event data and reliably scraping/processing real-time news/social media across multiple languages for secondary leagues can be difficult and costly. (2) Feature Engineering: The effectiveness of matchup features depends heavily on the quality and granularity of underlying event data. (3) Contextual Noise: Sentiment analysis is inherently noisy and susceptible to sarcasm, irrelevant chatter, and manipulation. (4) Model Complexity & Overfitting: Combining diverse features requires careful model tuning and validation to avoid overfitting. (5) Market Adaptation: Betting markets adapt; any identified inefficiency may diminish over time if exploited widely.
                                 * Reflexiones éticas: While aiming for rational betting decisions, any tool facilitating gambling must acknowledge the risks of problem gambling. Transparency about model limitations and responsible staking strategies (like those implied by Kelly criterion) are crucial. The potential for misuse or impact on market integrity should be considered.
                                 * Trabajo Futuro: Future work could involve: extending CAMVM to more leagues and sports; incorporating live, in-play data and odds for dynamic prediction; exploring more sophisticated NLP techniques for context extraction; developing adaptive betting strategies that account for changing market efficiency; investigating the specific types of matchups or contextual situations where the model performs best.

Context-Aware Matchup Value Model for Profitable Upset Prediction in Secondary European Football Leagues


Abstract: The challenge of consistently generating profit from football betting, particularly on low-probability upset outcomes, persists due to market efficiencies and the limitations of current prediction models. These models often overlook the granular tactical interactions between opponents and underutilize dynamic contextual information. This research proposes a Context-Aware Matchup Value Model (CAMVM) specifically designed to identify potentially profitable underdog bets in secondary European football leagues. The CAMVM's novelty lies in its integration of explicit strength-vs-weakness matchup features derived from detailed historical event data, real-time contextual analysis incorporating news and social media sentiment, and an optimization strategy focused on maximizing betting Return on Investment (ROI) for underdog selections within the hypothesized less efficient secondary league markets. The expected outcome is that CAMVM will identify value betting opportunities by exploiting specific tactical mismatches and incorporating dynamic context that are often missed by general prediction models and the market's odds. This paper details the proposed CAMVM framework and outlines a hypothetical experimental validation plan.
1. Introducci\u00f3n:
The landscape of sports analytics has witnessed remarkable expansion in recent years, paralleling the burgeoning growth of the sports betting industry. This expansion is largely fueled by the increasing availability of comprehensive sports data and significant advancements in the field of machine learning.1 Consequently, sophisticated predictive models are being developed and applied to various aspects of sports, including forecasting match outcomes for betting purposes.1 While these models have shown promise, the pursuit of consistent profitability in football betting, especially when targeting less probable "upset" outcomes, remains a considerable challenge. This difficulty arises primarily from the inherent efficiency of established betting markets, particularly in major football leagues.7Many existing prediction models often rely on aggregated team-level statistics, such as overall form, average goals scored, and historical head-to-head records.7 While these features provide a general overview of team performance, they frequently fail to capture the intricate tactical dynamics and specific player-level interactions that are crucial in determining the outcome of a particular match.16 Furthermore, the integration of dynamic contextual information, encompassing real-time news updates, social media sentiment surrounding teams, and fluctuations in player morale, is often limited in current modeling approaches.16 This oversight can be significant, as these factors can introduce considerable variance and unpredictability into match outcomes, particularly for underdog teams with lower perceived chances of victory.Recognizing these limitations, this research identifies a scientific opportunity in shifting the focus from simply maximizing prediction accuracy towards optimizing for betting-specific metrics, most notably the Return on Investment (ROI).16 Moreover, secondary European football leagues, which typically receive less media attention and betting volume compared to major leagues, may exhibit lower market efficiency.16 This potential inefficiency could create a more fertile ground for exploiting prediction model advantages, especially when targeting undervalued underdog teams.
To address these limitations and capitalize on this opportunity, this paper introduces the Context-Aware Matchup Value Model (CAMVM). The CAMVM is a novel approach specifically designed for the prediction of profitable upset bets in secondary European football leagues. Its core innovation lies in the unique combination of advanced statistical matchup analysis and real-time contextual analysis, tailored for maximizing betting ROI on underdog selections. The subsequent sections will delve into the existing literature, detail the proposed CAMVM framework, outline a hypothetical experimental design for its evaluation, and finally, present concluding remarks.
2. Estado del arte:
The academic literature on football match outcome prediction presents a diverse landscape of statistical and machine learning models. Traditional statistical approaches, such as the Elo rating system and Poisson regression, have been foundational in estimating team strength and predicting scoring rates.16 However, these models often rely on simplifying assumptions that may not fully capture the complexities of real-world football matches. In recent years, machine learning techniques have gained prominence in this field, with models like regression analysis, Random Forests, Gradient Boosting, Neural Networks, and Support Vector Machines being applied extensively.1 These models typically utilize historical match data and team statistics as input features to learn patterns and predict future outcomes. While accuracy rates for these models in major leagues often fall within the 70-80% range, achieving consistent profitability in betting markets, particularly on less probable events, remains a significant hurdle.1 A recurring limitation is the tendency of these models to focus on predicting the overall winner or the total number of goals, often relying on aggregated team-level statistics that may not adequately reflect the specific tactical nuances and player-level interactions crucial for upset predictions.16 Ensemble methods, which combine the predictions of multiple models, such as Random Forests and Gradient Boosting, have demonstrated strong predictive capabilities in football by leveraging the strengths of individual models and mitigating their weaknesses.36Feature engineering plays a critical role in the development of effective prediction models. Commonly used features include historical win/loss records, goals scored and conceded, player injuries, and basic team ratings.7 More advanced models may incorporate metrics like Expected Goals (xG) to provide a more refined assessment of team performance.69 However, the application of these advanced statistics in a directly comparative manner to analyze the specific strengths of one team against the weaknesses of their opponent is often limited in the existing literature. Data sources for major football leagues are generally well-established, with numerous APIs and sports data providers offering comprehensive datasets.94 However, obtaining granular event data, such as individual player actions and positioning data, for secondary European leagues, which is crucial for engineering sophisticated matchup features, might necessitate accessing specialized data providers or employing web scraping techniques.The efficiency of betting markets, as described by the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH), suggests that betting odds should accurately reflect the true probabilities of match outcomes, thereby making it challenging to consistently identify profitable betting opportunities.7 Nevertheless, empirical evidence indicates that betting markets can exhibit inefficiencies and biases, such as the favorite-longshot bias, which could potentially be exploited by well-designed prediction models.9 Evaluating the performance of betting models requires the use of metrics specifically relevant to profitability, such as Return on Investment (ROI) and calibration, in addition to traditional accuracy measures.16 Many studies have found it difficult to achieve a consistently positive ROI in football betting using prediction models, underscoring the need for more innovative approaches.16 Secondary European football leagues, which typically receive less media coverage and betting volume compared to major leagues, might exhibit lower market efficiency, potentially offering more opportunities for identifying value bets on underdogs.8 Furthermore, optimizing models for calibration, ensuring that the predicted probabilities accurately reflect the likelihood of different outcomes, is crucial for successful betting, potentially even more so than simply maximizing overall prediction accuracy.98The influence of various contextual factors on football match outcomes has been explored in research, including player injuries, team morale, news sentiment, and even external conditions like weather.1 However, the integration of deep statistical analysis focusing on specific tactical matchups between opponents, which goes beyond simple team ratings and considers individual player and unit-level comparisons, is relatively scarce in the context of betting prediction models.3 This gap presents a significant opportunity for developing models that explicitly model these tactical nuances by comparing specific team strengths against opponent weaknesses using detailed historical event data and combining this in-depth matchup analysis with real-time contextual information to identify potentially profitable upset opportunities.

	This review of the existing literature highlights several key limitations and opportunities that the proposed CAMVM aims to address. The lack of deep, statistically driven matchup analysis, the limited integration of dynamic contextual factors, the relative neglect of secondary league markets in academic research, and the prevailing focus on prediction accuracy rather than betting profitability represent significant gaps that CAMVM is designed to fill.
3. Propuesta (CAMVM):
The Context-Aware Matchup Value Model (CAMVM) is proposed as a novel framework for identifying potentially profitable upset bets in secondary European football leagues. The core principle behind CAMVM is that by combining a detailed, statistically driven analysis of the tactical matchup between two opponents with real-time contextual information, and by specifically optimizing for the ROI of underdog bets in less efficient markets, it is possible to identify value betting opportunities that are often missed by more general prediction models and the broader betting market.
The primary objectives of the CAMVM project are:
                                 1. To engineer a comprehensive set of advanced statistical features that explicitly compare the strengths of one team against the weaknesses of their opponent across various tactical dimensions.
                                 2. To integrate real-time contextual data, including pre-match news sentiment and player availability, into the model to capture dynamic factors influencing team performance.
                                 3. To develop a machine learning model that is specifically optimized for maximizing the ROI of bets placed on underdog teams in secondary European football leagues.
                                 4. To hypothetically test the effectiveness of the CAMVM compared to baseline models that do not incorporate matchup analysis or real-time context.
The CAMVM is envisioned as a decision support tool for value-oriented sports bettors seeking to identify profitable opportunities in football. Its ability to pinpoint specific tactical advantages and disadvantages between opponents could also provide valuable insights for football analysts and coaches looking to understand the underlying dynamics of matches beyond simple aggregate statistics. By focusing on secondary leagues, CAMVM aims to tap into markets where information asymmetry and lower betting volumes might lead to more pronounced odds mispricing.
3.1 Datasets a utilizar:
The development and hypothetical validation of the CAMVM would require access to several key datasets:
                                 * Detailed Historical Event Data: This dataset would be the foundation for engineering the advanced statistical matchup features. Ideally, it would include granular event-level data for a selection of secondary European football leagues (e.g., Portuguese Primeira Liga, Belgian Pro League, Scottish Premiership) spanning several seasons. Potential sources for this data could include specialized sports data providers that offer detailed football statistics or, hypothetically, a combination of publicly available data and web scraping techniques to collect the necessary information. The key requirement is access to data that allows for the calculation of specific team strengths and weaknesses across various tactical aspects of the game.
                                 * Betting Odds Data: Historical betting odds for the selected secondary leagues would be essential for several purposes: defining underdogs, calculating implied probabilities, and evaluating the model's performance in terms of ROI. Data from odds aggregation websites like Oddsportal or BetExplorer could serve as a hypothetical source for this information.
                                 * Real-Time Contextual Data: To incorporate dynamic contextual factors, the model would require access to real-time data feeds. This could include:
                                 * News Data: Local news outlets and sports news websites covering the selected leagues would be scraped for pre-match news, including information on player injuries, suspensions, team lineup changes, and other relevant events that could impact team performance.
                                 * Social Media Sentiment Data: Platforms like Twitter (now X) could be monitored using relevant keywords and hashtags to gauge the prevailing sentiment surrounding the teams in the lead-up to a match. Sentiment analysis techniques would be applied to quantify the overall positive, negative, or neutral sentiment.
The focus on secondary leagues presents a key difference in data acquisition compared to models focused on major leagues. While data for major leagues is often readily available through established APIs, obtaining the necessary granular event data and comprehensive statistics for secondary leagues might require more specialized sources or the development of robust web scraping pipelines. Similarly, capturing localized news and sentiment for these leagues might necessitate targeting specific regional news outlets and social media channels.
3.2. Atributos a inferir (Model Output):
The primary outputs of the CAMVM would be the predicted probabilities for the three possible outcomes of a football match:
                                 * P(H): The probability of the home team winning.
                                 * P(D): The probability of the match ending in a draw.
                                 * P(A): The probability of the away team winning.
In addition to these probabilities, and crucial for the model's objective, CAMVM would also infer the predicted ROI for betting on the underdog team in each match:
                                 * Predicted ROI for Underdog (Home/Draw/Away): This output would indicate the expected return on investment if a bet were placed on the underdog (based on the betting odds) winning or drawing the match, taking into account the model's predicted probability of that outcome and the odds offered by the bookmakers. This calculation could potentially utilize variants of the Kelly criterion to suggest optimal bet sizing.
As an auxiliary output, the model could also provide:
                                 * Predicted Key Mismatch Score/Type: This output would aim to identify and quantify the most significant tactical mismatch between the two opponents, along with the specific type of mismatch (e.g., aerial vulnerability, pressing weakness). This could provide valuable insights into why the model predicts a potential upset.
3.3. Atributos de entrada (Inputs & Preprocessing):
The CAMVM would utilize a diverse set of input features, which can be broadly categorized as follows:
                                 * Engineered Matchup Features: These features would be the cornerstone of the model, designed to directly compare the specific strengths of one team against the corresponding weaknesses of their opponent. Examples of such features could include:
                                 * Aerial_Duel_Mismatch: Calculated as the difference or ratio between Team A's aerial duel win percentage in attacking areas and Team B's aerial duel win percentage in defensive areas.
                                 * Pressing_vs_BuildUp: Measured by comparing Team A's success rate in pressing the opponent in their own half against Team B's success rate in building up play under pressure.
                                 * Wing_Attack_vs_Fullback_Defense: Determined by comparing Team A's rate of creating chances from crosses or wing play against Team B's success rate in defending against such attacks by their fullbacks.
                                 * Counter_Attack_Efficiency_Mismatch: Calculated by comparing Team A's efficiency in scoring from counter-attacks against Team B's vulnerability to conceding goals from counter-attacks.
                                 * Set_Piece_Mismatch: Assessed by comparing Team A's success rate in scoring from set pieces (e.g., corners, free kicks) against Team B's defensive record in set-piece situations.
These features would be calculated using detailed historical event data for both teams over a relevant time window (e.g., the current season and potentially the previous season). The calculation could involve simple differences or more complex ratios depending on the specific tactical aspect being compared.
                                    * Other Engineered Features: In addition to the matchup-specific features, the model would also incorporate other engineered features capturing general team performance:
                                    * Weighted Form: A measure of a team's recent performance, giving more weight to more recent matches.
                                    * Momentum: An indicator of whether a team is on a winning or losing streak, and the length of that streak.
                                    * Contextual Features: These features would capture the dynamic, real-time context surrounding the match:
                                    * Pre-match Sentiment Score: A numerical score derived from the sentiment analysis of news articles and social media posts related to each team in the days leading up to the match. This score would reflect the overall positive or negative sentiment.
                                    * Injury/News Flags: Binary flags indicating the presence of key player injuries, suspensions, or other significant pre-match news that could impact team performance.
                                    * Standard Features: The model would also include more traditional features commonly used in football prediction:
                                    * Betting Odds: The pre-match betting odds for home win, draw, and away win.
                                    * Elo Ratings: A measure of each team's overall skill level based on a historical performance rating system.
                                    * Home Advantage: A binary feature indicating whether a team is playing at their home stadium.
The preprocessing of these input features would involve several steps: normalization and scaling of numerical features to ensure they are on a comparable scale; sentiment scoring of text data from news and social media; and the creation of feature interaction terms if deemed necessary to capture more complex relationships between variables. A key difference in the input attributes of CAMVM compared to standard models is the explicit focus on comparative advanced statistics that directly define the tactical matchup between opponents, along with the integration of dynamic contextual information.
3.4. M\u00e9todos a utilizar:
Given the complexity of the problem and the diverse nature of the input features, the CAMVM would likely employ ensemble machine learning methods for prediction. Potential candidates include:
                                    * Gradient Boosting Machines (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM): These algorithms are known for their ability to capture complex non-linear relationships and interactions between features, and they often achieve state-of-the-art performance in various prediction tasks.36
                                    * Random Forests: Another powerful ensemble method that can handle a large number of features and is less prone to overfitting.37
                                    * Calibrated Neural Networks: A neural network model, if carefully calibrated, could also be used to predict the probabilities of the different outcomes. Calibration would be essential to ensure the reliability of the predicted probabilities for betting purposes.24
The choice of the specific machine learning method would be determined through experimentation and evaluation on a development dataset. Calibration of the model's probability outputs would be a crucial step to ensure that the predicted probabilities align well with the actual frequencies of outcomes.
A key aspect of the CAMVM is the use of a custom loss function during the training process. Unlike standard loss functions that primarily aim to maximize prediction accuracy, the custom loss function for CAMVM would be designed to prioritize the identification of profitable underdog bets. This could be achieved by incorporating information about the betting odds directly into the loss function, potentially giving higher weight to predictions where a significant tactical mismatch is identified and the odds offered for the underdog are particularly attractive. For instance, the loss function could be designed to maximize a simulated profit based on historical odds, possibly using variants of the Kelly criterion for bet sizing.24 This explicit focus on ROI optimization, particularly for underdog bets, distinguishes CAMVM from many traditional prediction models that primarily focus on overall accuracy.
4. Propuesta de experimentaci\u00f3n:
To hypothetically evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed CAMVM, a rigorous experimental design would be implemented. This would involve using a time-series cross-validation approach, where the model is trained on historical data up to a certain point in time and then tested on subsequent matches to simulate real-world betting scenarios and avoid lookahead bias.182
The CAMVM's performance would be compared against several baseline models:
                                    * Odds Only: A simple baseline that places bets solely based on the implied probabilities derived from the betting odds, potentially favoring underdogs with higher odds.
                                    * Standard ML without Matchup/Context: A standard machine learning model (e.g., Gradient Boosting or Random Forest) trained on traditional features like historical form, basic team statistics, and Elo ratings, without the engineered matchup features or real-time contextual data.
                                    * Standard ML with Context Only: A machine learning model trained on the same traditional features as above, but with the addition of the real-time contextual features (sentiment score, injury/news flags).
                                    * Standard ML with Matchup Only: A machine learning model trained on the same traditional features, but with the inclusion of the engineered advanced statistical matchup features.
The hypothetical dataset for this experimentation would ideally comprise approximately 5000 matches across three selected secondary European football leagues (e.g., Portuguese Primeira Liga, Belgian Pro League, Scottish Premiership) spanning a period of 10 seasons. This volume of data would provide a sufficient sample size for training robust models and conducting meaningful evaluations.
While actual experimental results are not included in this hypothetical paper, the theoretical reasoning suggests that CAMVM should outperform the baselines for several key reasons. By explicitly modeling the exploitable weaknesses of one team against the strengths of their opponent through the engineered matchup features, CAMVM aims to identify specific tactical advantages that might be overlooked by more general models.3 Furthermore, the incorporation of real-time contextual data allows the model to capture the immediate state and morale of teams, potentially identifying situations where an underdog might be more likely to perform above expectations.95 By specifically targeting underdogs in secondary leagues, which are hypothesized to be less efficient markets, and by optimizing the model's training using a custom loss function focused on ROI, CAMVM is expected to be more effective at identifying valuable betting opportunities.
The evaluation would likely show an improved ROI for CAMVM, particularly on bets placed on underdogs, even if the overall prediction accuracy is not dramatically higher than a standard model that might perform well at predicting favorites. An ablation study, where the matchup features and contextual features are individually removed from the CAMVM, would further demonstrate the value added by each of these components to the model's performance and profitability. Additionally, the calibration of the model's predicted probabilities would be assessed to ensure their reliability for betting decisions.
5. Conclusiones:
This paper proposed the Context-Aware Matchup Value Model (CAMVM) as a novel approach for predicting profitable upset bets in secondary European football leagues. The CAMVM framework uniquely combines advanced statistical analysis of tactical matchups, real-time contextual information, and ROI-focused optimization specifically for underdog selections in potentially less efficient markets.
The primary contribution of this research lies in the introduction of explicit strength-vs-weakness matchup features, the integration of dynamic contextual data, the specific focus on maximizing betting ROI rather than just prediction accuracy, and the targeted application to secondary European football leagues. This combination of elements represents a novel approach to football betting prediction.
The potential benefits of CAMVM include the ability to identify potentially profitable betting opportunities on underdogs by exploiting specific tactical mismatches and incorporating real-time context often missed by general prediction models and market odds. This could lead to a positive ROI for informed bettors and provide valuable tactical insights for football analysts.
However, the proposed model also has potential limitations. The effectiveness of the advanced matchup features is heavily dependent on the availability of detailed historical event data for the target leagues. The quality and reliability of real-time contextual data, particularly sentiment analysis from social media, can be noisy and challenging to interpret accurately. The complexity of the model and the custom loss function might require significant computational resources for training and deployment. Furthermore, as with any successful betting strategy, the market may adapt over time, potentially reducing the model's effectiveness. Ethical considerations surrounding responsible gambling must also be paramount in the development and application of such predictive tools.2Future work could explore the application of CAMVM to a wider range of secondary leagues and potentially adapt the model for live betting scenarios by incorporating real-time in-game statistics and contextual updates.37 Further research could also investigate the use of dynamic weights for the matchup features based on the specific characteristics of the opposing teams and the evolving game context.
