,Prediction of Future NBA Games' Point Difference: A Statistical Modeling Approach,"As the NBA (National Basketball Association) is becoming more and more popular, people are trying to predict score differences of each game for many reasons, including for gambling. There are a lot of factors that can affect the game result. The aim of this article is to establish a convincing but simple model to predict the point difference for each game using previous game results, as well as deriving team ability and separate home advantages based on data from five seasons. By analyzing the games from 2012 to 2016, the model makes reasonable predictions by analyzing some crucial factors, such as team ability and home advantage, even as compared to the bookie's point spread. Although there are still some factors that are not concerned by the data, such as injuries, fouls and trades, the prediction of this model is still convincing. This paper applies the ""least square fit"" model to create a best-fit model. By comparing the standard error of the results, the best linear regression model is created and team strengths for each year is derived, providing good predictions.",10.1109/MLBDBI48998.2019.00056,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8945583,IEEE,Si,Prediccion NBA,Standard Error,Linear Regression - OLS (Ordinary Least Squares),Baloncesto,NBA,masculino,No,Conversion de HTML a Matrices,410 partidos,Equipo local y visitante,privado,Goldsheet,Predecir la diferencia de puntos,Point Difference,1.1 STD,Obtenidos de Goldsheet,"2011/12, 2012/13, 2013/14, 2014/15, 2015/16","Jiayi Lu, Yuan Chen, Yida Zhu","- utilizar otros modelos

,Predictions of european basketball match results with machine learning algorithms,"The goal of this paper is to build and compare methods for the prediction of the final outcomes of basketball games. In this study, we analyzed data from four different European tournaments: Euroleague, Eurocup, Greek Basket League and Spanish Liga ACB. The data-set consists of information collected from box scores of 5214 games for the period of 2013-2018. The predictions obtained by our implemented methods and models were compared with a vanilla model using only the team-name information of each game. In our analysis, we have included new performance indicators constructed by using historical statistics, key performance indicators and measurements from three rating systems (Elo, PageRank, pirating). For these three rating systems and every tournament under consideration, we tune the rating system parameters using specific training data-sets. These new game features are improving our predictions efficiently and can be easily obtained in any basketball league. Our predictions were obtained by implementing three different statistics and machine learning algorithms: logistic regression, random forest, and extreme gradient boosting trees. Moreover, we report predictions based on the combination of these algorithms (ensemble learning). We evaluate our predictions using three predictive measures: Brier Score, accuracy and F-1-score. In addition, we evaluate the performance of our algorithms with three different prediction scenarios (full-season, mid-season, and play-offs predictive evaluation). For the mid-season and the play-offs scenarios, we further explore whether incorporating additional results from previous seasons in the learning data-set enhances the predictive performance of the implemented models and algorithms. Concerning the results, there is no clear winner between the machine learning algorithms since they provide identical predictions with small differences. However, models with predictors suggested in this paper out-perform the vanilla model by 3-5% in terms of accuracy. Another conclusion from our results for the play-offs scenarios is that it is not necessary to embed outcomes from previous seasons in our training data-set. Using data from the current season, most of the time, leads to efficient, accurate parameter learning and well-behaved prediction models. Moreover, the Greek league is the least balanced tournament in terms of competitiveness since all our models achieve high predictive accuracy (78%, on the best-performing model). The second less balanced league is the Spanish one with accuracy reaching 72% while for the two European tournaments the prediction accuracy is considerably lower (about 69%). Finally, we present the most important features by counting the percentage of appearance in every machine learning algorithm for every one of the three analyses. From this analysis, we may conclude that the best predictors are the rating systems (pi-rating, PageRank, and ELO) and the current form performance indicators (e.g., the two most frequent ones are the game score of Hollinger and the floor impact counter).",10.3233/JSA-220639,http://dx.doi.org/10.3233/JSA-220639,WOS,Si,Prediccion Basket,"Brier Score, F1 Score, Accuracy","Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost",Baloncesto,"Euroleague, Eurocup, Greek Basketball League, Liga ACB",masculino,No,Normalización,5214 partidos,"Estadísticas de partidos (puntos, asistencias, rebotes, robos, pérdidas, etc.)

Ivan,Football and the 2013 German Bundestag Election: the Causal Influence of Emotions Originating Outside of Politics on Elections; [Fußball und die Bundestagswahl 2013: Der kausale Einfluss von ursprünglich nicht-politischen Emotionen auf Wahlen],"What influence do emotions that originate outside politics have on German federal elections? In this paper, we estimate the causal effects of football (soccer) results from the first German Bundesliga on party-list district data during the election weekend in 2013. The results from a difference-in-differences design analysis relative to the 2009 elections reveal that football results are a quasi-random treatment and thus function as a natural experiment with regional variation. Incumbent parties benefited from a positive outcome for the local football team, as measured by the difference in goals in a statistically significant result. In contrast, opposition parties did not lose clearly from these positive outcomes. The results for the oppoistion parties were sometimes significant, but always had the expected points estimates. All effects were moderated by the timing of the matches relative to the closing of the election: the greater the time lag, the smaller the effects, although these effects were not always statistically significant, either. There was no evidence that betting odds, as the best information available before the match about the potential result, moderated the effects. Overall, the results only partially support the aggregated implications of the micro-logic of “blind retrospection” due to imprecise and instable estimates. © 2019, Deutsche Vereinigung für Politikwissenschaft.",10.1007/s11615-019-00188-4,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85074143416&doi=10.1007%2fs11615-019-00188-4&partnerID=40&md5=422c51f52155e9f9d3306c84eb61e9f8,SCOPUS,No,"Relaciona como el resultado de un partido de futbol afecta a las emociones y luego esto a las elecciones, no predice nada de partidos",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ivan,Expert Analysis: The Reciprocal Relationship between Sports Gambling and Fantasy Football on Television,"Television coverage of football gambling established the industrial preconditions within sports media for fantasy sports coverage to emerge and proliferate. Coverage of gambling and fantasy sport encourages active, dedicated consumptive behaviour and participation from audiences. The popularization of content devoted to these activities illuminates key tensions marking the discourses around both sports betting and fantasy football since leagues like the NFL have distanced themselves from gambling. Nonetheless, paratextual television programmes dedicated to sports gambling developed the discursive frameworks that define sports betting and fantasy football as skill- and research-based pastimes. Gambling experts, especially Jimmy ‘the Greek’ Snyder, facilitated the emergence of contemporary ‘fantasy gurus’ like ESPN’s Matthew Berry. These on-air experts brand themselves through a particular combination of statistical analysis, commentary, and humor. Both Snyder and Berry analyze statistical data and trends to offer viewers reasons to put specific players in weekly fantasy lineups or bet a certain way. Historically, sports betting and fantasy football programmes have had a mutually-beneficial relationship with media industries. This relationship reveals the process by which marginal forms of sports media can move from the periphery to the center of fan culture. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",10.1080/09523367.2021.1876673,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85101194004&doi=10.1080%2f09523367.2021.1876673&partnerID=40&md5=cae94db65d575be9d4842e3a83683cab,SCOPUS,No,"No tiene que ver con predccion, es la relacion entre programas de televisión y el gambling",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ivan,Cross-Cultural Difference of Free Agency (FA) System Between MLB and NPB (Nippon Professional Baseball),"This study explored FA system of MLB and NPB, and summarized the cross-cultural difference of FA between MLB and NPB. First, the cognitive biases that are observed in common to both leagues were discussed from the viewpoint of our propensity to inaccurately predict the future. Second, the cross-cultural difference was discussed from the two viewpoints: (1) difference of mindset between two leagues, and (2) difference of authority of commissioner between two leagues. Finally, it was proposed how inefficiencies in baseball markets in sports management (failure in FA) should be avoided for the coexistence of teams and the prosperity of the league.",10.1007/978-3-030-20145-6_56,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-20145-6_56,WOS,No,"Analiza el sistema free agency, no le veo ninguna utilidad",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Player Pricing Mechanisms and the Daily Fantasy Sport Chance Versus Skill Debate,"Differentiating and defining games of skill versus chance have major legal implications when classifying gambling, especially in relation to daily fantasy sports in the United States. This paper provides a theoretical discussion and introduces an empirical approach to analyzing game player pricing mechanisms. If game pricing mechanisms are fully efficient-player prices fully reflect the expected contributions from players-then that game is one of chance since there is no opportunity for skill to play a role in outcomes. This paper examines player prices from DraftKings' daily fantasy football product. Empirical results show that there are strategies deriving from the pricing mechanism that can be incorporated by skilled participants to increase their expected performance and improve their chances of winning. This provides evidence that daily fantasy sports are skill-based-a necessary condition for skill to be a predominant factor in game outcomes as part of the legal debate.",10.32731/IJSF/164.112021.04,http://dx.doi.org/10.32731/IJSF/164.112021.04,WOS,Si,"Es sobre el precio en el fantasy, se podria usar",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Your subscription does not include this content.,
,Holdover Bias in the College Football Betting Market,"This article investigated the efficiency of the college football betting market for the following season’s first game for members of the final Associated Press Top 25 Poll. Market inefficiency was identified, with bets against these teams winning significantly more than half the time. Separate analysis of the top 10 and the remaining members of the Top 25 indicated that the inefficiency was due to the previous season’s top 10 being significantly overvalued in the betting market at the start of the next season. Bets against the top 10 teams won significantly more than the 52.4% necessary for profitability. This was especially true when they played non-Power 5 schools. Efficiency could not be rejected for the teams ranked 11 through 25. The study contributed to the literature on betting market efficiency by providing evidence that bettors could be backward-looking and over-rely on outdated information. © International Atlantic Economic Society 2019.",10.1007/s11293-019-09611-y,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85062797734&doi=10.1007%2fs11293-019-09611-y&partnerID=40&md5=6b43339e9d1868fc7e30e5e5b12bfdc5,SCOPUS,Si,Betting,"Likelihood Ratio Test, Win % contra spread",No aplica,Fútbol Americano,NCAA College Football,masculino,No,No menciona,174 partidos,Ranking final de la temporada anterior,No se sabe,No proporciona,Ver si apostar en contra de los equipos del Top 25 es rentable,Cobertura del Spread,"- Top 25 cubre spread 42% de las veces

,Predicting the outcome of future football games using machine learning algorithms,"Sports predictions has gained popularity as a topic of study thanks to the development of sports analytics and the accessibility of extensive and sophisticated match data. In this paper, a machine learning-based (ML) strategy for forecasting football match results is presented. In the past, the number of goals scored by each team in a football (FB) game served as a benchmark for assessing a team's performance and projecting future outcomes to forecast the results of football games, such as win, draw, or defeat. However, there are significant discrepancies between a team's performance and the number of goals scored or conceded throughout many games because the number of goals scored during a match contains a significant random element.The goal of this study is to create an accurate and dependable prediction model that will help fans, analysts, and bet enthusiasts make wise selections. The selection of features, treatment of data that is imbalanced and the generalization of models constitute significant issues that are addressed in this paper. The system learns patterns from previous encounters and player attributes to develop predictions for upcoming games. Various machine learning algorithms, including random forests (RF), support vector machines (SVM), and regression, are experimented with. The main goal of this research is to investigate various Machine Learning techniques to forecast football game results utilizing in-game match events and individual and team statistics off the field. As football remains a globally popular sport, the integration of machine learning for match prediction offers an exciting avenue for enthusiasts to enhance their understanding and enjoyment of the game.",10.1109/RMKMATE59243.2023.10370000,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10370000,IEEE,Si,ML pra predecir partidos,Accuracy,"Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine",Fútbol,premiere league,masculino,No,"One-Hot Encoding, limpieza de datos, eliminación de valores atípicos",No especifica,"Estadísticas de jugadores y equipos

,Passing toWin: Using Characteristics of Passing Information for MatchWinner Prediction,"Predictingthe football match results has received great attention both in sports industry and academic fields. Many researchers have studied on predicting the match outcome using the simple features such as the number of shots and passes. However, little attention has been paid to using pass interaction features, which can represent how players in a match interact to each other. To this end, we propose a win-lose prediction model that predicts a match result using the pass interaction and other features, achieving high accuracy of 79.5%. By conducting an ablation study, we find that the proposed interaction features play an important role in accurately predicting match results. We believe our work can provide important insights both for industry and academic researchers who want to understand the characteristics of winning teams.

Ivan,Precompetitive anxiety and self-confidence during the 2023 Finnish Padel championship in high level men’s players,"The aim of the current study was to assess precompetitive anxiety and self-confidence in high level men’s padel players from Finland. Twenty eight men’s padel players from the highest category participated in the research (87.5% of the target population). The CSAI-2R (Competitive State Anxiety Inventory-2 Revised) and STAI-S (State–Trait Anxiety Inventory – State) questionnaires were used and descriptive and inferential analyzes were performed, including the Kruskal Wallis’s H and Mann–Whitney’s U tests. The results show that seeded players presented lower levels of cognitive anxiety (η2 = 0.111). Moreover, losers of first round presented more state anxiety than winners (η2 = 0.302). Before the first match, state anxiety was higher than prior to the second match (η2 = 0.148). Furthermore, lower ranked players of first round, compared to second, presented more state anxiety and somatic anxiety (η2 = 0.487 and η2 = 0.277, respectively). However, according to the results obtained, self-confidence was not affected by any of the variables analyzed (ranking, seed, result or round). These findings may be of great interest to players, coaches and sports psychologists, as they allow an enhanced comprehension of the player’s level of anxiety and self-confidence.

Ivan,Those who counter match-fixing fraudsters: voices from a multistakeholder ecosystem,"This study sheds light on the match-fixing ecosystem, with particular focus on those entities engaged in protecting the integrity of competitions. It analyzes the characteristics of match-fixers, as perceived by some anti-match-fixing stakeholders; the known processes of match-fixing and their evolution; and the interactions among stakeholders in the match-fixing ecosystem. Results show that while anti-match-fixing actors seem to have only a fuzzy idea of match-fixers' characteristics, they appear to know quite well how fraudsters manipulate games. Meanwhile, fixers seem to have adapted their processes across time in response to harsher countermeasures according to two main strategies: layering, in which mules are used to place bets on multiple operators to conceal suspicious betting pattern algorithms, and diversification/displacement, in which fixers decide to pursue new betting options or to target minor leagues or other, less monitored sports. Some fixers did not have to adapt since in many countries police investigations remain rare and criminal sanction mild. Further research should encourage comparative perspectives beyond the European dimension, develop a more systematic effort to establish a sport fraudsters typology, and focus on non-betting-related sports manipulations.",10.1007/s10611-020-09889-z,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10611-020-09889-z,WOS,No,"Tiene que ver más con el sistema de apuestas y como estafan, no con lo nuestro",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ivan,Do not bet on your favourite football team: the influence of fan identity-based biases and sport context knowledge on game prediction accuracy,"Research question: While the influence of sport context knowledge, such as home advantage and team ranking, on prediction accuracy has been discussed in the previous literature, the role of identity-based biases, such as fans’ level of team involvement and the selection of their favourite team, in betting behaviour remain unclear. The main purpose of this study is to develop an understanding of how sport fans’ biases and sport context knowledge influence the accuracy of sport game predictions. Research methods: A smartphone application enabled us to collect real soccer game predictions and results. A total of 529 football fans participated in 53,943 predictions of 2353 professional football games within a mobile smartphone application. Chi-square tests and logistic regressions were used to analyse the data. Results and findings: Chi-square test results indicate that individuals overestimate their favourite team to win, as well as they split their predictions into dichotomous outcomes by overestimating wins and losses and underestimating draws. Logistic regression analyses indicate that identity-based biases negatively influence prediction accuracy, whereas individuals’ sport context knowledge positively contributes to prediction accuracy. Implications: The study contributes to our understanding of the Psychological Continuum Model, individual biases, social identity theory and the psychological concept of splitting. Findings have implications for organizations who need to understand fans’ sport gambling behaviour and sport fans who seek to optimize their game prediction accuracy to improve their bets and fantasy team selections. © 2018, © 2018 European Association for Sport Management.",10.1080/16184742.2018.1530689,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85055744103&doi=10.1080%2f16184742.2018.1530689&partnerID=40&md5=9dedaf1c9b12f4df7d251035d533f5d8,SCOPUS,No,"Es sobre que los fans apuestan a su propio equipo y eso no es lo correcto, hasta ahí llego yo también",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ivan,FRAMEWORK BASED ON CONFORMAL PREDICTORS AND POWER MARTINGALES FOR DETECTION OF FIXED FOOTBALL MATCHES,"One of the difficult problems that arises during football competitions is match-fixing. In terms of negative effect, such shameful phenomena are commensurate with the problem of doping. This paper has analyzed known methods for the possible detection of match-fixing, including sociological analysis of participants in match-fixing, methods for predicting the outcome of the match, analysis of bets and performance of the player or team during the match. It is noted that the assessment of match-fixed results in the considered methods is carried out based on the analysis of a large amount of data. But such information is not always available. Given the insufficient formalization of the problem area, it is relevant to conduct research that does not require a large amount of non-publicly available data but, at the same time, makes it possible to effectively identify potentially suspicious matches regarding a fixed result. The description of the input data is formalized in the form of a data structure containing a chronological history of the results of football seasons, the ranking of teams and matches of the season depending on the overall result of the teams in the season. A method for detecting suspicious football matches with a fixed result has been built using conformal predictors and power martingales within which a new measure of non-conformity has been introduced to determine atypical football matches. To obtain a generalization of the statistics of atypical matches, a power submartingale was used. Evaluation of the effectiveness of the developed method for detecting suspicious football matches was carried out based on precision and recall of the classification metrics using data on the 2013–2014 season of the French II League. The quality of work of the developed method reaches 85 % in terms of precision metric, 96 % in terms of recall metric, and 0.853 in terms of metric F1 © 2023, Authors.

Tipsters in this community are ranked according to the betting return on their tips, but there are no prizes for accuracy. Nevertheless, we find that aggregated tips in this community contain information not in betting prices. A strategy of betting when a majority predict an outcome produces average returns of 1.317% for 68,339 events. The accuracy of these forecasts stems from the wisdom of the whole crowd, as selecting sections of the crowd based on experience or past forecast accuracy does not improve betting returns.

Ivan,Home advantage and away goals rule: An analysis from Brazil Cup,"In football, many people argue that in knock-out competitions the team that plays the second game in its stadium would have an advantage, a greater probability of victory in the final outcome of a two leg knock-out match. The purpose of this study is to verify the veracity of this statement using data from the Brazil Cup. We find evidence that the ability spread between the teams participating in a match is the main factor that explains the qualification of one of the teams for the next round. Until 2018, there were three criteria for break the tie in the Brazil Cup, they were used in the respectively order: goal difference, away goals rule, penalty shootout (there is no extra-time in any play-off of the championship). It is estimated that 36% of the matches end tied and need a criterion to determine the winner. Of these, 51% use the goal difference decision, 29% use the away goals rule and 20% penalty shoot-out. When considering the championship in general there is evidence that the home team wins the match in approximately 63% of the matches, a significant advantage. However, in the confrontations that were decided by the away goals rule or the penalty shoot-out, the home team wins percentage is 20% lower, indicating that these criteria level the odds of both teams.",10.3233/JSA-200370,http://dx.doi.org/10.3233/JSA-200370,WOS,No,"Infuencia de jugar en casa y eso, pero no hace ninguna predicción ni nada relacionado",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,Re-examining the bias and market inefficiency in eSports betting markets: On the application of multivariate regression model,"Favorite-longshot and reverse favorite-longshot biases have become widespread in various traditional sports betting markets in recent years. However, there is a limited number of investigations that have been conducted on the eSports betting market or the bettors that operate within it. In the present research, we have made efforts to re-examine the bias and market inefficiency in four typical eSport games: League of Legends, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, Dota 2, and King of Glory. Due to the natural characteristics of e-sports, we analyze the reasons for the market biases from 4 aspects: commission, region, match format, and tournaments. We find that both the favorite-longshot and reverse favorite-longshot bias occur in eSports.

Ivan,Intelligent and dynamic method to specify chronological order of the games to improve the excitement and fairness of the champions in simulation league,"RoboCup champions aimed at improving artificial intelligence methods. Competition formats include elimination, double elimination and round-robin. In soccer simulation league an agents' energy and knowledge in each game is independent of previous or simultaneous games. So when the format is round-robin the result is fair and the chronological order of holding games doesn't affect the result. In this paper, by using three heuristic functions, a new intelligent method for providing a dynamic table for specifying chronological order of holding games is presented. By using this method the important and determinative games were held at the end of the competitions. It can make championships more exciting and avoid extra games after round-robin; Therefore total evaluation specify the winner, the ranks are fairer and the RoboCup champions get closer to its' scientific goals. The evaluation showed that this dynamic method improved excitement in comparison to static methods and was 66% closer to the most exciting state evaluation.",10.1109/RIOS.2016.7529510,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7529510,IEEE,No,"Esto es sobre decidir el orden de los partidos, no nos interesa",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ivan,Do uncertain outcomes matter for ticket prices? Examination of the National Football League's secondary ticket market,"PurposeThis study examines the impact of outcome uncertainty on the National Football League (NFL) secondary ticket market prices. As a demand-driven market, it is essential to comprehend how resellers respond to outcome uncertainty, one of the consumer demand factors in sports.Design/methodology/approachUsing real-time ticket prices and money lines as a proxy of the probabilities of winning, this study employs a regression analysis and examines 33,554 price observations from the NFL's secondary ticket market partner, StubHub.FindingsThe result shows a positive relationship between outcome uncertainty and secondary market ticket prices, indicating that resellers adjust the prices in response to the level of outcome uncertainty and put more value on games with greater uncertainty. This finding confirms the demand-driven nature of the secondary ticket market, as outcome uncertainty is one of the demand factors in sports.Originality/valueThis study links the uncertainty of outcome hypothesis with secondary ticket market pricing and fills a gap in the literature by providing an important perspective on games with uncertainty in the secondary ticket market. Outcome uncertainty has limited understanding in relation to secondary ticket market pricing despite its relationship with consumer demand. The positive relationship between outcome uncertainty and the ticket prices, grounded in real-time price data and win probability from sport betting markets, enhances our understanding of price determinations in the secondary ticket market.",10.1108/SBM-03-2024-0026,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/SBM-03-2024-0026,WOS,No,Es sobre predecir el precio de los ticckets,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,A gamma process based in-play prediction model for National Basketball Association games,"This paper presents an in-play prediction model based on the gamma process for the scoring processes of the National Basketball Association matches. The model is team-specific, i.e., it takes account of the relative strengths of the two teams playing in a match. The dependence between the home and away scoring processes is characterized by a common latent variable. A Bayesian dynamic forecasting procedure for future games is developed, which utilizes the in-match information to update the scale parameter of the model as the match progresses. An evaluation against baseline models is provided in an empirical study. Our proposed model can predict the final score and total points, while the baseline models are unable to make such predictions. Furthermore, our model can produce positive returns on the point spread betting market and the over-under betting market. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

,An Optimal Algorithm for Finding Champions in Tournament Graphs,"A tournament graph is a complete directed graph, which can be used to model a round-robin tournament between $n$n players. In this paper, we address the problem of finding a champion of the tournament, also known as Copeland winner, which is a player that wins the highest number of matches. In detail, we aim to investigate algorithms that find the champion by playing a low number of matches. Solving this problem allows us to speed up several Information Retrieval and Recommender System applications, including question answering, conversational search, etc. Indeed, these applications often search for the champion inducing a round-robin tournament among the players by employing a machine learning model to estimate who wins each pairwise comparison. Our contribution, thus, allows finding the champion by performing a low number of model inferences. We prove that any deterministic or randomized algorithm finding a champion with constant success probability requires $\Omega (\ell n)$Ω(ℓn) comparisons, where $\ell$ℓ is the number of matches lost by the champion. We then present an asymptotically-optimal deterministic algorithm matching this lower bound without knowing $\ell$ℓ, and we extend our analysis to three variants of the problem. Lastly, we conduct a comprehensive experimental assessment of the proposed algorithms on a question answering task on public data. Results show that our proposed algorithms speed up the retrieval of the champion up to $13\times$13× with respect to the state-of-the-art algorithm that perform the full tournament.",10.1109/TKDE.2023.3267345,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10102661,IEEE,Si,Lo unico que depende de si hacemos predicciones en liga o torneo ,Recall,Find Winner,,,,No,No,6890 queries,"Número de nodos, arcos, matches lost de cada equipo, resultados de comparaciones",No se sabe,-,Predecir el ganador de un torneo,Ganador de un torneo,27% de aciertos ,No se mencionan,,"Lorenzo Beretta, Franco Maria Nardini, Roberto Trani, Rossano Venturini",- Probarlo con algún torneo relacionado con deportes como pueden ser los Play Offs o la Champions,

Ivan,Change in the biomechanical characteristics of running as a result of an individual 1-year program for training an elite athlete with visual impairment for Paralympic Games,"Introduction. To identify the effectiveness of an individual track and field sprint training program for an elite athlete with visual impairment to improve running techniques and increase competitive performance. Methods. An elite athlete, a Paralympic medallist and winner in the 2016 World Championship of Athletes with disabilities was involved in the study. An individual training program was developed, based on improving speed endurance and the kinaesthetic analyser. The biomechanical indicators of running were determined for 100-m running. Results. The value of the angle in the knee joint at the time of thigh raising, as well as the speed of movement of the ankle and knee joints at the time of thigh raising and at the time of lowering the leg increased significantly (p < 0.05). A significant decrease in the running time of running steps during the development of maximum speed at a distance (p < 0.05) was revealed. Elimination of delays in lowering the leg after thigh raising was found. The time of 100-m running decreased significantly. Conclusions. The athlete became the champion of the world and the silver medallist of the Paralympics in 2016 as a result of applying the individually developed training program. © University School of Physical Education in Wrocław.",10.5114/PQ.2020.95771,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85091452927&doi=10.5114%2fPQ.2020.95771&partnerID=40&md5=edf54f64e25f54afbaece06a56b783d6,SCOPUS,No,"No tiene absolutamente nada que ver, me alegro mucho por los paralímpicos tho",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ivan,AI-based betting anomaly detection system to ensure fairness in sports and prevent illegal gambling,"This study develops a solution to sports match-fixing using various machine-learning models to detect match-fixing anomalies, based on betting odds. We use five models to distinguish between normal and abnormal matches: logistic regression (LR), random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), the k-nearest neighbor (KNN) classification, and the ensemble model—a model optimized from the previous four. The models classify normal and abnormal matches by learning their patterns using sports betting odds data. The database was developed based on the world football league match betting data of 12 betting companies, which offered a vast collection of data on players, teams, game schedules, and league rankings for football matches. We develop an abnormal match detection model based on the data analysis results of each model, using the match result dividend data. We then use data from real-time matches and apply the five models to construct a system capable of detecting match-fixing in real time. The RF, KNN, and ensemble models recorded a high accuracy, over 92%, whereas the LR and SVM models were approximately 80% accurate. In comparison, previous studies have used a single model to examine football match betting odds data, with an accuracy of 70–80%. © The Author(s) 2024.",10.1038/s41598-024-57195-8,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85188065379&doi=10.1038%2fs41598-024-57195-8&partnerID=40&md5=9b0e02f7b9158ca0614d5fc8a8a7233f,SCOPUS,No,Es para la detección de partidos amañados,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Are betting returns a useful measure of accuracy in (sports) forecasting?,"In an economic context, forecasting models are judged in terms not only of accuracy, but also of profitability. The present paper analyses the counterintuitive relationship between accuracy and profitability in probabilistic (sports) forecasts in relation to betting markets. By making use of theoretical considerations, a simulation model, and real-world datasets from three different sports, we demonstrate the possibility of systematically or randomly generating positive betting returns in the absence of a superior model accuracy. The results have methodological implications for sports forecasting and other domains related to betting markets. Betting returns should not be treated as a valid measure of model accuracy, even though they can be regarded as an adequate measure of profitability. Hence, an improved predictive performance might be achieved by carefully considering the roles of both accuracy and profitability when designing models, or, more specifically, when assessing the in-sample fit of data and evaluating out-of-sample forecasting performances.

,Dynamic Bayesian forecasting models of football match outcomes with estimation of the evolution variance parameter,"Statistical models of football (soccer) match outcomes have potential applications to areas such as the development of team rankings and football betting markets. Much of the published work in this context has typically focused on the use of generalized linear models, which are non-dynamic in the sense that the parameters in the model, which often represent the underlying abilities of each team, are assumed to remain constant over time. Dynamic generalized linear models (DGLMs) on the other hand allow the abilities of each team to vary over time. This paper illustrates the application of a DGLM in the context of football match outcome prediction and describes improvements on similar work previously presented by the author, in relation to the estimation of a parameter in the model, referred to as the evolution variance, which is crucial in terms of optimizing the predictive performance of these types of models. Match results data from the Scottish Premier League from 2003/2004 to 2005/2006 are used to show that the DGLM approach provides improved predictive probabilities of future match outcomes compared to the non-dynamic form of the model. DGLMs are also Bayesian in terms of their structure and so a Bayesian approach to parameter estimation is required. This paper therefore illustrates a practical implementation of the DGLM model that can easily be deployed using the freely available software WinBUGS.",10.1093/imaman/dpq018,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8132918,IEEE,Si,,"AUC, MSE",Linear Regression - OLS (Ordinary Least Squares),"Fútbol, Tenis, Fútbol Americano","premiere league, liga española, Bundesliga, Serie A, WTA, NCAA College Football",masculino,No,Eliminar partidos con cuotas faltantes,17646,"- Cuotas

Ivan,Swimming fast when it counts: A 7-year analysis of Olympic and world championships performance,"Context/Background: International-level swimmers periodize their training to qualify for major championships, then improve further at these events. However, the effects of various factors that could affect performance progressions have not been described systematically. Purpose: To quantify the pattern of change in performance between season best qualifying time and the major championships of the year and to assess the influence of time between performance peaks, ranking at themajor events, stroke, event distance, sex, age, and country. Methods: A total of 7832 official competition times recorded at 4 FINAWorld Championships and 2 Olympic Games between 2011 and 2017 were compared with each swimmer's season best time prior to the major event of the year. Percentage change in performance was related with the time elapsed between season best and major competition, race event, sex, age, and country using linear mixed modeling. Results: Faster performance (-0.79% [0.67%]; mean [SD]) at the major competition of the year occurred in 38% of all observations vs 62% no change or regression (1.10% [0.88%]). The timing between performance peaks (<34 to >130 d) had little effect on performance progressions (P = .83). Only medal winners (-0.87% [0.91%]), finalists (-0.16%[0.97%]), andUS swimmers (-0.44%[1.08%]) progressed between competitions. Stroke, event distance, sex, and age had trivial impact on performance progression. Conclusions: Performance progressions at Olympic Games and World Championships were not determined by timing between performance peaks. Performance progression at a major competition appears necessary to win a medal or make the final, independent of race event, sex, and age. © 2019 Human Kinetics, Inc.",10.1123/ijspp.2018-0782,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85071773995&doi=10.1123%2fijspp.2018-0782&partnerID=40&md5=2c06f7535c3001bbcdf789d8f788a865,SCOPUS,No,"Es sobre la evolución de la velocidad de nadadores, puede parecer que si, pero no le veo utilidad con lo nuestro",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ivan,The visibility of gambling sponsorship in football related products marketed directly to children,"UK law prohibits direct marketing of gambling to children. However, our data, gathered between 2018 and 2020, demonstrate that gambling logos occur frequently in football-related products and media consumed by children. This is a pressing issue for policymakers because research suggests that although children engage with football as spectators, they engage more often through readily available material culture. Discussions in the media about sponsorship of football teams by gambling companies have focused on the exposure of children to advertisements during live broadcasts. Analysing visible gambling sponsorship in children’s media, this paper shows how a single gambling logo on a player’s shirt is refracted many times through collectable cards, football magazines and the mediatized ‘play’ of a child fan’s world. It concludes that discussions around gambling advertising and its impact on children should be informed by an awareness of how children, as opposed to adults, engage with football. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",10.1080/14660970.2020.1860028,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85097529135&doi=10.1080%2f14660970.2020.1860028&partnerID=40&md5=a64a8aa1fbb1cf1c35bc23cfaa972fa6,SCOPUS,No,Ya sabemos que anunciar gambling no mola,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ivan,A TIMELY WARNING THAT VIGILANCE CAN BE EXPECTED OF PARTICIPANTS IN AS WELL AS SPECTATORS AND OTHER BYSTANDERS AT ROAD RUNNING EVENTS - A BRANCH OF SPORT SEEMINGLY DEVOID OF RISK,"In South Africa road-running has developed into a very popular sport over the last few years. Those participating in it range from novices to professionals, the homeless to billionaires. Notwithstanding the vast numbers of participants, spectators and other bystanders present at road-running events, very few injuries and fatalities have thus far been recorded, and then exclusively in respect of participants. Cases of injuries or fatalities to spectators and bystanders can rather be expected in other forms of sport and recreation such as cricket, rugby, golf and car races, although our jurisprudence is devoid of any such examples, with one exception, namely Clark v Welsh (1975 4 SA 469 (W); 1976 3 SA 484 (A)), containing extensive obiter dicta applicable to spectator injuries. In the USA there have been some development regarding the law applicable to spectator injuries, while English law contains only a few judgments dealing specifically with this topic. In both American and English law it would appear that delictual liability for the causing of injury to spectators and other bystanders is mostly dependent on a finding of negligence, although the doctrine of volenti non fit iniuria also features in some cases. In the case at hand, Kalmer, a well-known top South African Olympian, seriously injured a spectator/bystander, Salie, who had negligently stepped into the runners' path, by running into her at full speed during the annual Spar ladies' race in Cape Town. In the Cape Town high court Salie failed in her damages claim against both Western Province Athletics who had organised the event, and Kalmer. The court found no negligence in the conduct of both defendants. Salie subsequently passed away and her appeal to the full Cape court was brought by Davids in her capacity as executrix of the latter's deceased estate. The appeal partially succeeded, as the court found Kalmer to have been negligent. The court issued an order based on section 1(1)(a) of the Apportionment of Damages Act in terms of which the appellant could recover only 30 per cent of proven damages in view of a finding of 70 per cent contributory negligence on Salie's part. Gamble J first dealt with the claim against Kalmer. After meticulously analysing the evidence, he found that she had been negligent because she could have avoided the accident by keeping a better lookout - based on case law applicable to the drivers of motor vehicles in collision cases, with reference inter alia to drivers' reaction times. Furthermore, it was held that the injured Salie had not been a spectator in the strict sense of the word, but an occasional bystander, rendering the case law applicable to spectators useless. It is argued that the court erred in this regard, mainly because the analogy drawn between the conduct of an athlete such as Kalmer and the driver of a motor vehicle in ordinary traffic is a strained one. A better analogy would have been that of a racing driver during the Monte Carlo F1 race, or a cyclist in the Tour de France contest. Furthermore, the court contradicted itself in characterising Salie as a disconnected bystander on the one hand, and someone fully aware of her surroundings on the other hand. It is further argued that the outcome of this appeal would mean that top athletes who have developed a successful running style over a prolonged period - which style has the effect that they cannot keep a proper lookout over longer distances (as in this case) - would have to adapt their style according to the specific venues of events, which is unacceptable as it would adversely affect their performance. Although the court favoured Kalmer (or her insurer) with its reduction of the amount of damages to be proven by 70 per cent, she was held responsible for the appellant's legal costs. Furthermore, the reduced amount of damages will probably still be considerable. This is an extremely unfair outcome for a top performer who merely exercised her sport in an accepted way to achieve her best performance.

,Forecasting football match results in national league competitions using score-driven time series models,"We develop a new dynamic multivariate model for the analysis and forecasting of football match results in national league competitions. The proposed dynamic model is based on the score of the predictive observation mass function for a high-dimensional panel of weekly match results. Our main interest is in forecasting whether the match result is a win, a loss or a draw for each team. The dynamic model for delivering such forecasts can be based on three different dependent variables: the pairwise count of the number of goals, the difference between the numbers of goals, or the category of the match result (win, loss, draw). The different dependent variables require different distributional assumptions. Furthermore, different dynamic model specifications can be considered for generating the forecasts. We investigate empirically which dependent variable and which dynamic model specification yield the best forecasting results. We validate the precision of the resulting forecasts and the success of the forecasts in a betting simulation in an extensive forecasting study for match results from six large European football competitions. Finally, we conclude that the dynamic model for pairwise counts delivers the most precise forecasts while the dynamic model for the difference between counts is most successful for betting, but that both outperform benchmark and other competing models. © 2018 International Institute of Forecasters",10.1016/j.ijforecast.2018.10.011,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85060302194&doi=10.1016%2fj.ijforecast.2018.10.011&partnerID=40&md5=942cd86d4b1982079dc62333e373c556,SCOPUS,Si,,"Rank Probability Score (RPS), Diebold-Mariano (DM) test","Score-Driven, Bivariado Poisson, Skellam",Fútbol,"premiere league, Bundesliga, liga española, Serie A, Ligue 1(francia)",masculino,No,Limpieza de datos,~15.000 partidos,"Número de goles (local y visitante), diferencia de goles, resultado (victoria/empate/derrota), fuerzas de ataque defensa, ventaja de ser local",público,http://www.football-data.co.uk,"Predecir resultados de partidos (victoria, empate, derrota) baso en series temporales",Victoria Empate Derrota,Bivariado Poisson y Skellam un ARPS de around 0.19-0.2,,"1999/2000, 2000/01, 2001/02, 2002/03, 2003/04, 2004/05, 2005/06, 2006/07, 2007/08, 2008/09, 2009/10, 2010/11, 2011/12, 2012/13, 2013/14, 2014/15, 2015/16","Siem Jan Koopman, Rutger Lit","Incluir variables en tiempo real (lesiones, clima)",Sesgo en datos al limitarse a ligas europeas
,Artificial Swarm Intelligence vs Vegas Betting Markets,"In the natural world, Swarm Intelligence (SI) is a commonly occurring process in which biological groups amplify their collective intelligence by forming closed-loop systems. It is well known in schools of fish, flocks of bird, and swarms of bees. In recent years, new AI technologies have enabled networked human groups to form systems modeled after natural swarms. Known as Artificial Swarm Intelligence (ASI), the technique has been shown to amplify the effective intelligence of human groups. This study compares the predictive ability of ASI systems against large betting markets when forecasting sporting events. Groups of average sports fans were tasked with predicting the outcome of 200 hockey games (10 games per week for 20 weeks) in the NHL. The expected win rate for Vegas favorites was 62% across the 200 games based on the published odds. The ASI system achieved a win rate of 85%. The probability that the system outperformed Vegas by chance was extremely low (p = 0.0057), indicating a significant result. In addition, researchers compared the winnings from two betting models - one that wagered weekly on the Vegas favorite, and one that wagered weekly on the ASI favorite. At the end of 20 weeks, the Vegas model generated a 41% financial loss, while the ASI model generated a 170% financial gain.",10.1109/DeSE.2018.00014,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8648561,IEEE,Si,"170% financial gain, IM IN","Precision, ROI",Artificial Swarm Intelligence (ASI),Hockey,NHL,masculino,No,No menciona,200 partidos,"Resultados de partidos, cuotas de Vegas, margen de victoria (1 gol vs. 2+ goles)",público,www.sportsbook.ag,Comparar la precisión predictiva de sistemas ASI frente a mercados de apuestas de Vegas en hockey,"Victoria o Derrota, Point Difference","ASI 85% precision, Vegas 62%, ASI ROI 170%",Partidos de la NHL,2017/18,"Louis Rosenberg, Gregg Willcox","Hacerlo con un dataset más grande, no de 200 partidos solo

,Dense Neural Network used to Amplify the Forecasting Accuracy of real-time Human Swarms,"Artificial Swarm Intelligence (ASI) is a hybrid AI technology that enables distributed human groups to ""think together"" in real-time systems modeled on natural swarms. Prior research has shown that by forming ""human swarms,"" networked groups can substantially amplify their combined intelligence and produce significantly more accurate forecasts than traditional methods. The present study explores whether the rich behavioral data collected during ""swarming"" can be used to further increase the accuracy of swarm-based forecasts. To do this, a dense neural network was used to process the data collected during a set of swarm-based forecasts and generate a Conviction Index (CI) for each forecast that estimates its expected accuracy. This method was then tested in an authentic forecasting task – wagering on sporting events against the Vegas odds. Specifically, groups of sports fans, working as real-time swarms, were tasked with predicting the outcome of 238 NBA games over 25 consecutive weeks. As a baseline, the swarms achieved an impressive 25% net return on investment (ROI) against the Vegas Odds. This was compared to an enhanced method that used Conviction Index to (a) estimate the strength of each forecast and then (b) wager only on forecasts of sufficient strength. The CI-selected wagers yielded a 57% net ROI against Vegas Odds. This is a significant gain, equivalent to more than doubling the ROI of the naïve swarm betting strategy.",10.1109/CICN.2019.8902352,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8902352,IEEE,Si,"Aunque se parece demasiado al anterior, pinta bien",ROI,Red Neuronal,Baloncesto,NBA,masculino,No,normalización de datos,238 partidos,"(i) the percentage of users pulling for each target

Ivan,Analysis of the smash in men´s and women´s junior padel; [Análisis del remate en pádel junior masculino y femenino],"The objective of this study was to analyze the types of smashes in men´s and women´s junior padel according to the direction of the ball and its effectiveness, making a comparison between the men´s and women´s gender. To do this, 1175 smashes corresponding to six finals (three men’s and three women’s) of three Spanish junior championships were analyzed, differentiating the smashes analyzed between off the wall smash, tray, topspin smash and flat smash. The results show that junior padel players usually perform trays and topspin shots with a crossed trajectory, while flat smashes usually have a parallel trajectory. The flat smash is the type of smash with which players play the most winners (52%) and the tray with which they commit the most errors (39.2%). In addition, the tray is the type of smash that most encourages the continuity of the point (56.1%). Regarding the differences between genders, the results show that in women´s padel there is a greater use off the wall smash (13.8%) and flat smashes (36.5%), while in men´s padel there is a greater use of topspin smashes (22.6%). These results can serve as a reference for coaches and padel players when designing specific training sessions adapted to the demands of the competition, as well as for improving decision-making and establishing feedback. © 2023, Universidad Catolica San Antonio Murcia.

,SoccerNet: A Gated Recurrent Unit-based model to predict soccer match winners,"Winning football matches is the major goal of all football clubs in the world. Football being the most popular game in the world, many studies have been conducted to analyze and predict match winners based on players' physical and technical performance. In this study, we analyzed the matches from the professional football league of Qatar Stars League (QSL) covering the matches held in the last ten seasons. We incorporated the highest number of professional matches from the last ten seasons covering from 2011 up to 2022 and proposed SoccerNet, a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)-based deep learning-based model to predict match winners with over 80% accuracy. We considered match- and player-related information captured by STATS platform in a time slot of 15 minutes. Then we analyzed players' performance at different positions on the field at different stages of the match. Our results indicated that in QSL, the defenders' role in matches is more dominant than midfielders and forwarders. Moreover, our analysis suggests that the last 15-30 minutes of match segments of the matches from QSL have a more significant impact on the match result than other match segments. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed model is the first DLbased model in predicting match winners from any professional football leagues in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. We believe the results will support the coaching staff and team management for QSL in designing game strategies and improve the overall quality of performance of the players.  © 2023 AlMulla et al.

Ivan,Power and domination relationships in match fixing networks in Portuguese professional football,"This paper uses Pires’ (Sociologia Problemas E Práticas 100:41–63. 2022) analytical framework to analyse the power and domination relationships that govern the betting related match-fixing practices in Portuguese professional football. The analysis focuses on the “Jogo Duplo” (Double Game) prosecution order - the first and thus far the only Portuguese betting related match-fixing case tried in court - and on semi-structured interviews with two professional football players who were approached to fix matches by the so-called “Luso-Malaysian” group. Contrary to the realities of other countries which dictate the institutional discourse, the Portuguese case exposes a organised transnational criminal group established upon opportunities and characterised by amateurism and disloyalty, and in which the power dynamics are determined by the possession and structured allocation of a scarce material resource (money). In Portuguese professional football, threats seem to play a minor role in inducing football players to fix matches or in preventing reports. While the offer of bribes constituted the mandatory material resource to make the corrupt pacts viable, the use of moral and communicational resources was configured as a complementary mechanism to persuade the most undecided players. This research shows that in organised crime groups with a low level of sanctions, the players can refuse to participate in the game, adopt infidelity acts, or even decide to leave the game halfway through without experiencing resistance and conflict. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.",10.1007/s12117-024-09541-5,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85198975734&doi=10.1007%2fs12117-024-09541-5&partnerID=40&md5=a3c780bd7a62eb1468738ba4b4689587,SCOPUS,No,No le veo relacion con predecir el resultado de partidos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ivan,High prevalence of harmful drinking habits and gambling among professional rugby players: Mental health symptoms and lifestyle risks among New Zealand Super Rugby players - A cross-sectional survey,"Objectives Determining the prevalence of mental health and lifestyle risk factors (smoking, alcohol consumption, recreational drug use, gambling, family violence and anger management) in New Zealand (NZ) male professional rugby players. Study design Cross-sectional survey of mental health symptoms and lifestyle risk factors in male professional rugby players in NZ. Methods Players from all five NZ men's Super Rugby Franchises were invited to complete an online questionnaire (SportCHAT) measuring demographic status and mental health symptoms. Descriptive and interferential statistical analyses were used to identify the most prevalent mental health and lifestyle risk factors. Results 105 players participated in the study (response rate 52.5%). 51.4% of players were either at moderate or high risk for alcohol-related harm (defined as potential health, social, legal or financial problems linked to alcohol consumption). In comparison, 4.8% reported recreational drug use and 5% reported smoking tobacco. Twenty players (19%) reported engaging in gambling, with five of these reporting problematic gambling. 21% of players reported symptoms of depression, but none reached the 'mild depression' threshold of the Patient Health Questionnaire for Depression. Younger players (aged 20-29) were more likely to report symptoms of depression than older players (aged 30-39). The prevalence of anxiety symptoms was 17.1%. 66.7% of these players reported minimal symptoms (GAD-7 score 0-4) and 33.3% reported mild symptoms (GAD-7 score 5-9). Family violence was reported by 2.9% of respondents, while 12.4% reported issues with anger management. There were no significant differences between ethnic groups. Conclusion There is a higher prevalence of alcohol misuse and gambling, but lower reported rates of depression and anxiety symptoms in this cohort when compared with the general population.  © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2024.",10.1136/bmjsem-2024-002002,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85206810362&doi=10.1136%2fbmjsem-2024-002002&partnerID=40&md5=596ac563201ec244d5939f2c2646bcf2,SCOPUS,No,Esto tiene que ver con mental health,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ivan,Market Efficiency and Censoring Bias in College Football Gambling,"The team totals and point spread betting lines jointly predict team scores in college football games. The gambling market’s score predictions are shown to be biased due to censoring at zero points. This presents arbitrage opportunities for gamblers who place wagers on the team totals line in cases for which expected bias is high. A naïve betting strategy that exploits this bias using only information contained within the two betting lines themselves yields a win percentage of over 55 percent over the past two decades. This significantly exceeds the typical transaction costs associated with wagers, indicating the market is semi-strong inefficient. © The Author(s) 2023.",10.1177/15270025221148991,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85146622137&doi=10.1177%2f15270025221148991&partnerID=40&md5=299ef503a7b4c165110a204bad62e2d8,SCOPUS,No,"Esta medio interesante pero es más sobre el mercado y tal, no veo que podamos sacar nada para nosotros",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ivan,Bettors' reaction to match dynamics: Evidence from in-game betting,"It is still largely unclear to what extent bettors update their prior assumptions about the strength and form of competing teams considering the dynamics during the match. This is of interest not only from the psychological perspective, but also as the pricing of live odds ideally should be driven both by the (objective) outcome probabilities and also the bettors' behaviour. Using state-space models (SSMs) to account for the dynamically evolving latent sentiment of the betting market, we analyse a unique high-frequency data set on stakes placed during the match. We find that stakes in the live-betting market are driven both by perceived pre-game strength and by in-game strength, the latter as measured by the Valuing Actions by Estimating Probabilities (VAEP) approach. Both effects vary over the course of the match.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

Ivan,Beating the market with a bad predictive model,"It is a common misconception that in order to make consistent profits as a trader, one needs to possess some extra information leading to an asset value estimation that is more accurate than that reflected by the current market price. While the idea makes intuitive sense and is also well substantiated by the widely popular Kelly criterion, we prove that it is generally possible to make systematic profits with a completely inferior price-predicting model. The key idea is to alter the training objective of the predictive models to explicitly decorrelate them from the market. By doing so, we can exploit inconspicuous biases in the market maker's pricing, and profit from the inherent advantage of the market taker. We introduce the problem setting throughout the diverse domains of stock trading and sports betting to provide insights into the common underlying properties of profitable predictive models, their connections to standard portfolio optimization strategies, and the commonly overlooked advantage of the market taker. Consequently, we prove the desirability of the decorrelation objective across common market distributions, translate the concept into a practical machine learning setting, and demonstrate its viability with real-world market data.

,On predicting an NBA game outcome from half-time statistics,"Predicting the outcome of an NBA game is a major concern for betting companies and individuals who are willing to bet. We attack this task by employing various advanced machine learning algorithms and techniques, utilizing simple half-time statistics from both teams. Data collected from 3 seasons, from 2020/21 up to 2022/23 were used to assess the predictive performance of the algorithms at two axes. For each season separately, apply the algorithms and estimate the outcomes of the games of the same season and secondly, apply the algorithms in one season and estimate the outcomes of the games in the next season. The results showed high levels of accuracy as measured by the area under the curve. The analysis was repeated after performing variable selection using a non-linear algorithm that selected the most important half-time statistics, while retaining the predictive performance at high levels of accuracy. © The Author(s) 2024.",10.1007/s44163-024-00201-9,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85212936375&doi=10.1007%2fs44163-024-00201-9&partnerID=40&md5=5f9d35c102980cdb25744155dbd92b35,SCOPUS,Si,,AUC,"SVC, Random Forest, KNN, Red Neuronal, Logistic Regression",Baloncesto,NBA,masculino,No,"Limpieza de datos, validación cruzada 10-fold",3540 partidos,"Estadísticas de medio tiempo (puntos, FG%, FT%, asistencias, robos, pérdidas, rebotes ofensivos/defensivos, triples intentados y anotados)",público,https://www.basketball-reference.com,Predecir el resultado del partido basándose en estadísticas de medio tiempo,Victoria - no victoria local,"Ensemble con Random Forest obtuvo la mejor AUC (>90%), pero quiza overfit

Ivan,Effect of the contextual factors in competition on the performance of semi-professional soccer,"Problem Statement: Soccer players may behave differently in competition depending on various characteristics of the environment around them, as well as the possible strengths and limitations of internal characteristics. In addition, there are some studies about the physical demands according to the results (winners vs. losers). Approach: Knowledge of contextual factors such as imbalance in decision making and physical behavior in soccer competition. Purpose: The aims of this study were to know the effect of contextual variables (match location, field dimensions, opponent level, and match outcome) on the physical performance of semi-professional soccer players and, to know the interaction between these factors to achieve sports success. Methods: One hundred forty events in Spanish male semi-professional soccer players during the 2021-2022 season were analysed. WIMU devices (SportTrack®) of 18 Hz. and SPRO software were used. T-test, one-way ANOVA, Chi-square, and logistic regression tests were performed. Results: A greater physical performance was shown when the team played at home and in large fields. Regarding the match outcome, players covered higher total distance and walking distance when they won (p < .05). In addition, the sports success in the competition was associated with the field dimensions and the opponent level (x2 [2, n=105] = 16.737, p = .000, x2 (2, n=96) = 8.304, p = .016; respectively). Conclusions: Contextual factors influenced the physical performance of semi-professional players in official competition.

Methodology: a total of 1848 games were examined considering the match outcome (winner, draw or loser), the localization (home and away) and the order of scoring (first and second). Descriptive statistics and non-parametric tests were applied. Results: it was shown that local teams achieved a greater number of victories (Z = -4,51; p < 0,01) and scored more goals (Z = -4,51; p< 0,01) than the away ones. Home advantage was 62.46 % and this did not differ significantly among the championships (H = 10,86; p = 0,62). The advantage of scoring first was 78.86 % for home teams and 72.26 % for away ones. When the home team scored the first goal, they won 73.73 % of their matches, while the away ones ended up winning 58.12 % of their matches (χ. = 53,674; p < 0,001; phi = 0,17, V = 0,17). The top 4 teams in the ranking scored more goals and won more games both at home and away and had a superior scoring first advantage when played away compared to the teams than occupying the other positions. Conclusion: playing at home and scoring the first goal represented an advantage for teams to achieve positive results in the Costa Rican soccer championships analyzed.

,Predicting taekwondo winners in high-level competition using ranking scores and country performance scores: an analysis of the 2019 World Taekwondo Championship,"Background. The ranking system can be considered a measure of athletes’ performance. In addition, countries with high performance are expected to have better athletes. Problem and Aim. The present study aimed to verify whether ranking scores and country performance by competitors differ between winners and losers; and whether ranking scores and country performance by competitors could predict winners and losers in a high-level taekwondo competition. Methods. A total of 759 combats at the 2019 World Taekwondo (WT) Championship were analyzed in the present study. We used as variables the ranking scores and country performance score (CPS) calculated based on the number of Olympic medals won by a given country. The Bayesian t-test was used to estimate the difference in the rank score and CPS between winners and losers, and Support Vector Machine was used to predict the winners. Results. In summary, the results showed that both the ranking scores and CPS of losing athletes were lower than winners. Moreover the ranking score and CPS of the athlete and their opponent predicted the winners with a moderate degree of accuracy (higher than 0.70) in both the grouped sample and females separated out, but had low accuracy (0.69) in male athletes. Conclusions. Considering the complexity of a Taekwondo competition, it is possible to interpret that the ranking scores and the CPS of the competitors are important variables in predicting winners in high-level taekwondo competition. © Idōkan Poland Association",10.14589/ido.21.2.4,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85103709070&doi=10.14589%2fido.21.2.4&partnerID=40&md5=241ad5f87d657659da598b839fbabe3a,SCOPUS,Si,Taekwondo no lo considerabamos pero se puede sacar algo de info a lo mejor,Precision,SVC,Taekwondo,Mundial,"femenino, masculino",No,,759 combate,"Puntuación de ranking WT, CPS (basado en medallas olímpicas del país), género, categoría de peso",público,sports-reference.com/olympics/sports/TKW/,Predecir ganadores en competiciones de taekwondo usando variables de ranking y desempeño nacional,Victoria o Derrota,"Modelo combinado (ranking + CPS) logró precisión moderada (0.70-0.74).

We use the motivating and expository example of comparing the performances of the 2015-16 Golden State Warriors (who won a record 73 games) and the 1995-96 Chicago Bulls (who held the previous record of 72 wins) and provide a detailed treatment of this application. The more general applicability of the approach is examined by describing the flexibility in building the models and relating this flexibility to a few specific examples. We hope this paper will seed further explorations of retroactive gambling line simulation (and settle the Warriors vs. Bulls comparison along the way).",10.1109/WSC.2017.8247836,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8247836,IEEE,Si,,Season Performance Impressiveness SPI,"Montecarlo simulation, Regression",Baloncesto,NBA,masculino,No,Normalización de ratings mediante regresión para eliminar sesgo del equipo,No especificado,"Rating del equipo, ventaja de local",No se sabe,,Evaluar el desempeño de equipos mediante simulaciones,Victoria o Derrota,Warriors > Bulls,NBA,,"R.

,Data science approach to simulating the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 at a website in tribute to Maradona,"This article documents the authors’ experience developing an Argentinean website in tribute to Diego Maradona (301060.exactas.uba.ar) that leverages the popularity of football in South America (and the world) to illustrate the application of data science models in sports analytics. In particular, we demonstrate their use in computing probabilities associated with various events (winning matches, advancing rounds, and becoming champions) of the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022. Building on Dixon and Cole’s 1997 seminal model, we develop a competing Poisson model that incorporates for each participating team its attack and defense strengths as well as home-advantage effects. The calibration of the model considers match importance levels and emphasizes the recency of a team’s performance. Evaluations of the model’s results on various prediction accuracy and error metrics indicate that its performance equals or betters the traditional Poisson model and is similar to established betting sites. Our website featuring the model received over 30,000 visits from 11,000 users across 10 countries during the 2022 World Cup and garnered significant media coverage in Argentina. This successful endeavor underlines the potential of mathematics for predicting football match outcomes but also showcases its potential for countless practical applications and its ability to capture the attention and interest of a wide audience. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.",10.1007/s00180-024-01557-3,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85205227024&doi=10.1007%2fs00180-024-01557-3&partnerID=40&md5=4bd2b4dd6b1109f2996196e0a13e5e6f,SCOPUS,Si,,"Brier Score, Rank Probability Score (RPS)",Poisson competidor,Fútbol,Mundial,masculino,No,,MatchRate 33 (33 partidos por nación?),"Equipo, goles, torneo y local/visitante",público,No proporcionado,Simular resultados y calcular probabilidades de avance en el mundial 2022,"Victoria Empate Derrota, Ganador de un torneo",Brier y RPS de ~0.6,Partidos internacionales obtenidos de fuentes web públicas,"2014/15, 2015/16, 2016/17, 2017/18, 2018/19, 2019/20, 2020/21, 2021/22","Alejandro Álvarez, Alejandro Cataldo, Guillermo Durán, Manuel Durán, Pablo Galaz, Iván Monardo, Denis Sauré","Incorporar datos en tiempo real sobre lesiones, clima y tácticas,

,The wisdom of large and small crowds: Evidence from repeated natural experiments in sports betting,"Prediction markets have proved excellent tools for forecasting, outperforming experts and polls in many settings. But do larger markets, with a wider participation, perform better than smaller markets? This paper analyses a series of repeated natural experiments in sports betting. The Queen's Club Tennis Championships are held every year, but every other year the Championships clash with a major soccer tournament. We find that tennis betting prices become significantly less informative when participation rates are affected adversely by the clashing soccer tournament.

,Betting market efficiency and prediction in binary choice models,"Implied winning probabilities are usually derived from betting odds by the normalization: inverse odds are divided by the booksum (sum of the inverse odds) to ensure that the implied probabilities add up to 1. Another, less frequently used method, is Shin’s model, which endogenously accounts for a possible favourite-longshot bias. In this paper, we compare these two methods in two betting markets on soccer games. The method we use for the comparison is new and has two advantages. Unlike the binning method that is used predominantly, it is based on match-level data. The method allows for residual favourite-longshot bias, and also allows for incorporation of match specific variables that may determine the relation between the actual probability of the outcome and the implied winning probabilities. The method can be applied to any probabilistic classification problem. In our application, we find that Shin’s model yields unbiased estimates for the actual probability of outcome in the English Premier League. In the Spanish La Liga, implied probabilities derived from the betting odds using either the method of normalization or Shin’s model suffer from favourite bias: favourites tend to win their matches more frequently than the implied probabilities suggest. © 2022, The Author(s).",10.1007/s10479-022-04722-3,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85129176573&doi=10.1007%2fs10479-022-04722-3&partnerID=40&md5=3d22d0c2e39bb66ebcede2dd61b42ca5,SCOPUS,Si,,"Accuracy, F1 Score, AUC","Gradient Boosting, KNN, Red Neuronal",Fútbol,liga española,masculino,No,"Eliminacion de outliers

Ivan,Analysis of Service Execution in the On-line Sports Gambling Industry,"The on-line sports gambling industry has experienced significant growth in the last decade as well as a high-level of merger and acquisition activity among the leading multi-national companies that make up the sector. The companies in this sector also exhibit some of the unique challenges in on-line service supply chain management, including co-production process design, demand variability and resource utilization. Our research focuses on the post-merger service process design of one of these multi-national sports gambling organizations, particularly, on the efficient use of human resources within one of its service offerings (betting on soccer matches). Using discrete event simulation, a baseline model was developed to capture the “as-is” service process. The analysis identified number of bottlenecks, long queue times and capacity utilization issues. A revised “to-be” process was designed and when implemented, resulted in an increase of fourteen percent in overall utilization as well as removing variability in employee workload across the seven-day week. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",10.1007/978-3-030-04726-9_17,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85126206468&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-030-04726-9_17&partnerID=40&md5=ce9c68feae291aa6d1357d9f97850c08,SCOPUS,No,No tiene que ver con predecir outcomes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ivan,Harmful alcohol consumption in elite sports players in Ireland,"Background: Sportspeople are more prone to binge drink than their peers. Aims: We aimed to assess alcohol consumption, harms and behaviours in an elite Irish sporting population (Gaelic footballers and hurlers). Methods: An anonymous web-based questionnaire (demographics, alcohol consumption, culture and related harms) was administered to all elite players. The AUDIT-C questionnaire (frequency, quantity of alcohol consumption and frequency of binge drinking) was used to assess for adverse alcohol use. Univariate and multivariate analyses assessed for predictors of adverse alcohol use. Results: 717 players (mean age 24 years) were analysed. The majority of patients were male (75%), unmarried (93%) and had completed university (67%). 96% were current drinkers. Players consumed more alcohol during the off-season (median 20 versus 8 standard drinks in 28 days) compared to the elite season. Amongst current drinkers, 73% exhibit adverse alcohol use, 93% reported binge drinking and 65% an alcohol related harm in the past year. Most players would turn to family (36%) or friends (21%) for help. There were significant associations between monthly bingeing (OR 18.4), smoking (OR 3.3), generally drinking in public (OR 3.2), current gambling (OR 2.3), male gender (OR 2.1), an alcohol harm in the past year (OR 1.9) and adverse alcohol use. In contrast, co-habiting with a partner (OR 0.5) was protective. Conclusions: Excess alcohol consumption, alcohol related harms and binge drinking are prevalent in an elite sporting population, particularly during the off-season. Specific strategies are required to reduce alcohol related harms, particularly amongst high-risk groups during the off-season. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Royal Academy of Medicine in Ireland.",10.1007/s11845-021-02819-5,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85118167564&doi=10.1007%2fs11845-021-02819-5&partnerID=40&md5=bed670c2d06044c7cfc894a624aa2f46,SCOPUS,No,Que se cuiden un poco mas los irlandeses,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,Using the wisdom of crowds in sports: how performance analysis in football can benefit from the information enclosed in betting odds,"Betting odds have proven to contain highly accurate information on football matches, which researchers have used to study sports integrity, human behaviour, economic theories or forecasting, but widely neglected in performance analysis to date. The paper intends to stimulate changing this as betting odds contain a wealth of information usable to control for the inherent playing strength of teams as a situational variable and thus to better distinguish between strength, performance and success. Crowd wisdom and market efficiency are discussed as theoretical concepts driving the accuracy of betting odds. Moreover, based on a dataset of nearly 100 000 matches from 17 seasons in 17 European men’s football leagues, this study demonstrates that odds outperform methods related to points or goals in predicting the match winner as well as the anticipated number of goals by both teams. The code used in this study is made available to public in order to provide performance analysts with tools to extract information from odds. Finally, examples on how to benefit from betting odds in performance analysis are highlighted. Results of these use cases suggest that the relationship between performance and success can indeed be confounded by team strength, emphasising the need for further investigation. © 2024 Cardiff Metropolitan University.",10.1080/24748668.2024.2439034,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85212507705&doi=10.1080%2f24748668.2024.2439034&partnerID=40&md5=790b8206a05c36de6ee8a798f2039767,SCOPUS,Si,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Solo de pago incluso con la vpn de la uam
Ivan,Longitudinal playing trends among daily fantasy sports players,"Research suggests that populations of gamblers can adapt rapidly to online sports betting services after subscribing. This pattern of adaptation typically shows an initial play increase followed by a sharp overall betting (e.g., amount wagered and number of bets) decline. Such trends are consistent with models of exposure and adaptation. Although exposure and adaptation effects are observable in a variety of situations, currently we know very little about whether these trends are evident for daily fantasy sports. Understanding this is important because many have compared daily fantasy sports with traditional gambling. To examine this issue, we conducted a longitudinal analysis of daily fantasy sports play on the DraftKings website. We followed 11,338 unique DraftKings players, tracking their overall levels of engagement (i.e., total contest entries, total contest entry fees, and total participation) for 27 months. In this paper, we present daily and monthly trends for these activities. We observed increasing engagement over time among a minority of the most involved players (MIP; i.e., the top 1% of players on each engagement metric). Less involved players (LIP), who comprised the majority of the player pool (i.e., the remaining 99% of players on each metric), tended to exhibit elevated initial engagement followed by decreasing engagement over time. Aggregate playing trends for all groups of players were seasonal, with more engagement during National Football League seasons and less engagement during off-seasons. The results of this study suggest that models of exposure and adaptation, in addition to characterizing the population trends of online gambling activities such as online sports betting, likewise can help to explain population trends of most daily fantasy sports players. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.chb.2019.106165,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85074091007&doi=10.1016%2fj.chb.2019.106165&partnerID=40&md5=368b1e823fc2b18caf4162512e891ee7,SCOPUS,No,"Mundo de las apuestas pero una vez más, más enfocado a la psicología",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ivan,Sin city betting on the major leagues? An analysis of the sport-based approach to economic redevelopment in Las Vegas,"The city of Las Vegas, Nevada was one of the hardest hit communities in the United States during the 2008 Great Recession. As the nation emerged from the economic downturn, city and state officials worked together to create a framework through which the region could become more proactive in its future through economic diversification. That effort resulted in the creation of an urban regime, a working committee of private and public stakeholders who collaborated to offer recommendations to the governor. One such recommendation was a $750 million subsidy to build a large-scale football stadium, one of the largest sport facility public subsidy to date. This qualitative inquiry examined regime development and the decision-making process at the local and state level that led to approval of the stadium subsidy. Through a historical research approach, we examined how the Las Vegas stadium regime coalesced, and how economic conditions, politics, and ideology may have influenced the regime’s decision-making. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",10.1080/17430437.2021.1950142,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85110871026&doi=10.1080%2f17430437.2021.1950142&partnerID=40&md5=01040e095652700e5ef288c41d307dbd,SCOPUS,No,Es sobre la economia de las vegas,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,What the Eyes Don’t See: An Objective Assessment of Players’ Contribution to Team Success in Men’s Rugby League,"Purpose: This study addresses the lack of objective player-based metrics in men’s rugby league by introducing a comprehensive set of novel performance metrics designed to quantify a player’s overall contribution to team success. Methods: Player match performance data were captured by Stats Perform for every National Rugby League season from 2018 until 2022; a total of five seasons. The dataset was divided into offensive and defensive variables and further split according to player position. Five machine learning algorithms (Principal Component Regression, Lasso Regression, Random Forest, Regression Tree, and Extreme Gradient Boost) were considered in the analysis, which ultimately generated Wins Created and Losses Created for offensive and defensive performance, respectively. These two metrics were combined to create a final metric of Net Wins Added. The validity of these player performance metrics against traditional objective and subjective measures of performance in rugby league were evaluated. Results: The metrics correctly predicted the winner of 80.9% of matches, as well as predicting the number of team wins per season with an RMSE of 1.9. The metrics displayed moderate agreement (Gwet AC1 = 0.505) when predicting team of the year award recipients. When predicting State of Origin selection, the metrics displayed moderate agreement for New South Wales (0.450) and substantial agreement for Queensland (0.652). Conclusion: The development and validation of these objective player performance metrics represent significant potential to enhance talent evaluation and player recruitment. © 2024 The Author(s).

Ivan,Spontaneous head movements characterize losing athletes during competition,"Nonverbal movement behavior and emotions are closely linked processes; however, there is insufficient information about the spontaneous nonverbal expressions in response to experiencing positive and negative emotion, i.e., when winning or losing during sport competitions. Previous research showed that experienced tennis athletes detected losing behavior in athletes more accurately than winning behavior. However, it remained unclear what kind of nonverbal movements characterized losers because the actual movements have not been identified yet. Further research showed that head shaking occurred as an expression of doubt whereas head nodding appeared during successful actions. We therefore hypothesized that losing athletes nonverbally move more, and particularly execute more headshakes when compared to winners. The entire spontaneous nonverbal head movement behavior of professional tennis athletes was video-taped between points during competition and analyzed by two trained and certified raters using a standardized analysis system for nonverbal behavior in relation to won or lost points. The results showed that losers moved their head significantly more often, particularly executing more phasic upward, repetitive sideward (head shaking), and phasic sideward head movements when compared to winning athletes. The present results provide evidence that spontaneous nonverbal head movements differentiate winners from losers during competition. Losing a point in tennis is associated with to increased spontaneous head movement behavior, particularly in upward and sideward directions. Thus, we conclude that professional tennis athletes cannot inhibit their implicit nonverbal expressions that are related to negative emotions when losing. © The Author(s) 2020.",10.1177/1747954120934598,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85086727098&doi=10.1177%2f1747954120934598&partnerID=40&md5=7ab78a21db66c001a2f01ceb4857d240,SCOPUS,No,Interesante que muevan  la cabeza pero no creo que nos sea de mucha ayuda,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ivan,"Crowds vs swarms, a comparison of intelligence","For well over a century, researchers in the field of Collective Intelligence have shown that groups can outperform individuals when making decisions, predictions, and forecasts. The most common methods for harnessing the intelligence of groups treats the population as a “crowd” of independent agents that provide input in isolation in the form of polls, surveys, and market transactions. While such crowd-based methods can be effective, they are markedly different from how natural systems harness group intelligence. In the natural world, groups commonly form real-time closed-loop systems (i.e. “swarms”) that converge on solutions in synchrony. The present study compares the predictive ability of crowds and swarms when tapping the intelligence of human groups. More specifically, the present study tasked a crowd of 469 football fans and a swarm of 29 football fans in a challenge to predict 20 Prop Bets during the 2016 Super Bowl. Results revealed that the crowd, although 16 times larger in size, was significantly less accurate (at 47% correct) than the swarm (at 68% correct). Further, the swarm outperformed 98% of the individuals in the full study. These results suggest that swarming, with closed-loop feedback, is potentially a more effective method for tapping the insights of groups than traditional polling.",10.1109/SHBI.2016.7780278,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7780278,IEEE,No,Es de apuestas pero es más de comparar humanos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Fuzzy Study on the Winning Rate of Football Game Betting,"This study aims to find variables that affect the winning rate of the football team before a match. Qualitative variables such as venue, match importance, performance, and atmosphere of both teams are suggested to predict the outcome. Regression analysis is used to select proper variables. In this study, the performance of the football team is based on the opinions of experts, and the team atmosphere can be calculated with the results of the previous five games. ELO rating represents the state of the opponent. Also, the selected qualitative variables are expressed in fuzzy numbers using fuzzy partitions. A fuzzy regression model for the winning rate of the football team can be estimated by using the least squares method and the least absolute method. It is concluded that the stadium environment, ELO rating, team performance, and importance of the match have effects on the winning rate of Korean National Football (KNF) team from the data on 118 matches. © 2021. by the authors.

Ivan,"Long-term, multi-event surprise correlates with enhanced autobiographical memory","Antony et al. examine the link between multi-event long-term surprises and memory formation. Combined analysis of basketball fan questionnaires and public NBA data shows that surprising events are associated with better memory across timescales. Neurobiological and psychological models of learning emphasize the importance of prediction errors (surprises) for memory formation. This relationship has been shown for individual momentary surprising events; however, it is less clear whether surprise that unfolds across multiple events and timescales is also linked with better memory of those events. We asked basketball fans about their most positive and negative autobiographical memories of individual plays, games and seasons, allowing surprise measurements spanning seconds, hours and months. We used advanced analytics on National Basketball Association play-by-play data and betting odds spanning 17 seasons, more than 22,000 games and more than 5.6 million plays to compute and align the estimated surprise value of each memory. We found that surprising events were associated with better recall of positive memories on the scale of seconds and months and negative memories across all three timescales. Game and season memories could not be explained by surprise at shorter timescales, suggesting that long-term, multi-event surprise correlates with memory. These results expand notions of surprise in models of learning and reinforce its relevance in real-world domains.",10.1038/s41562-023-01631-8,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41562-023-01631-8,WOS,No,Tiene que ver con recuerdos ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ivan,Is there persistence among non-professionals? Evidence from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange Group Trading Challenges,"Purpose: The study systematically investigates persistence in performance for simulated trading among non-professional traders in the futures market. Design/methodology/approach: In this study, the authors employ a novel data set from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) Group's Trading Challenges for years 2014 through 2018 and expand upon the empirical methodology of Malkiel (1995) through improved interval estimations in testing for persistence in performance. The authors implement Fama-MacBeth style regressions to understand the degree of persistence in performance and the extent to which non-professionals extrapolate from prior returns. They adjust returns for risk through the Fama and French (2015) five-factor model in understanding whether the sample of non-professionals is able to produce excess returns after expenses and whether there is evidence of excess gross to cover expenses. Findings: The empirical analysis suggests strong evidence for performance persistence among non-professionals participating in the Preliminary Rounds. In the Championship Rounds, the authors find that the persistence effect becomes stronger in economic and statistical significance after accounting for expenses. The results suggest that competition and transaction costs help to distinguish between winners and losers. When conducting Fama-MacBeth style regressions, the authors present evidence that strongly supports the persistence effect and over-extrapolation. While the results of the multi-factor model analysis suggest that, after adjusting for risk, most teams are experiencing negative excess returns prior to expenses, the authors also uncover evidence of teams earning returns sufficient to cover their expenses. Originality/value: The authors bridge the gap between the literature on performance persistence and the emerging literature on non-professionals in the financial markets. Data from the CME Group’s Trading Challenge provide a rich source in studying the beliefs of non-professionals, and this study is helpful for understanding how beliefs, operationalized in simulated trades, perform over short time horizons, thereby providing insights into the behavioral dynamics of the financial markets. The results provide new empirical evidence for performance persistence among non-professionals. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",10.1108/RBF-09-2019-0122,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85090984258&doi=10.1108%2fRBF-09-2019-0122&partnerID=40&md5=ce3d52ffda4a012b9074372f8415292c,SCOPUS,No,"Trading y tal, no relacionado con betting",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Comparative Analysis of Point Difference between Winners and Losers in Badminton Women Singles,"Point difference in individual sports for performance or match analysis is a very niche area. The purpose of the present study was to compare the point difference between the winners and losers in three different phases of international badminton women’s singles matches. The data were only restricted to the 2019 World Championship matches of the women’s singles category for which the data of 105 games were used. The variables that were selected for analyzing the performance were maximum point difference and maximum consecutive points. The points for each game were divided into three different phases and accordingly the data were collected for all the games. In all the phases, the winners were found to be significantly (p < .05) ahead of the losers and the difference kept on increasing significantly over the phases with medium to large effect size. All the players who were ahead in the first phase of the game have won 70.47% of the matches. Similarly, players who were not ahead at any point of time in the first phase of the game, 75% had lost the game. Winners also had significantly (p < .05) higher consecutive points than the losers (ES = .65). On average, the winners were 6 points ahead of the losers in the second and the third phase of the game. In badminton, the first seven points are most crucial as they significantly increase the chances of winning. In this study, compared to the losers, winners kept on increasing the point difference in every phase. Whereas, in losers, the point difference reduced from phase 1 to phase 3. The results are helpful in enhancing the winning chances by tracking players’ performance, developing strategies and tactics based on point difference. © 2022, Horizon Research Publishing.

Ivan,Fraud and corruption in football: lessons from a survey of match-fixing in Cyprus,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to identify if fraud theory models suggested over the years are applicable to match-fixing and if so, whether the Krambia-Kapardis’ (2016) holistic fraud and corruption prevention model can be used to reduce significantly match-fixing in football. Design/methodology/approach: An online survey was developed by the authors and was administered to football stakeholders in Cyprus, namely, players, referees, coaches and team management. Findings: The research questions, who are the initiators of match-fixing, why is match-fixing taking place and what is the best way to prevent or reduce match-fixing, have been answered, and these findings have enabled the authors to make policy recommendations. Research limitations/implications: The survey considered match-fixing in only one sport (football) while the number of respondent categories and the 335 usable questionnaires returned did not allow advanced statistical analysis of the data obtained. Practical implications: The findings point to the need both for ethics and moral values to be installed in all the stakeholders through training and continuing education. It is also suggested that teams/clubs and related associations acting as regulators ought to implement governance principles and ethical programs, including whistleblowing lines and appoint integrity officers to minimize the match-fixing phenomenon. Furthermore, society, as well as government, sport regulators and sponsors, ought to encourage and demand fair play and integrity in sport through improved measures of governance and accountability and the implementation of ethical audits and public disclosure of audited financial statements of teams. Finally, sports integrity ought to be embedded in school curriculum from a very young age.

Ivan,Can Gift-Giving Affect Team Performance?,"In this paper, we analyze the relationship between the logic of gift and team performance. We explore this connection empirically, using a detailed data set from the National Basketball Association. In particular, we use the NBA Cares Community Assist Award as a way to measure gift-giving to the community. We explore the response of an entire team after one if its members has been recognized for his gift-giving behavior. Using two winners, we show that after a player has received the award there is an increase in the number of assists given by each member of the team, and that there is also an increase in the number of wins. Therefore, our results show that the team’s performance would improve after a player has been recognized because of his gift-giving attitude. This finding to management implies that managers’ incentivization of a sharing and giving philosophy would not only improve their relationship bond but it would also help them increase their performance. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",10.1007/s41463-022-00126-4,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85134218950&doi=10.1007%2fs41463-022-00126-4&partnerID=40&md5=d223b74a0d507e0fd4f969fe1ad8facc,SCOPUS,No,Más dirigido a la psicología,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Evaluation of Team’s False ‘9’ for Match Winner Prediction,"The quest to develop a concrete analysis on evaluation of teams false ‘9’ for match winner prediction depends on the predictability of match results. The main concern of this research is on the efficiency of team manager tactics that deals with the usage and feeding of false ‘9’ position in the football tactics used for a match. The effect of the false ‘9’ role in match prediction was also evaluated. The recent applied statistics literature has focused primarily on modelling goal scoring. The prediction of the match depends on variables like team statistics, historical data etc. which is used by managers and club directors to decide who is going to win the match and what is needed to win the match but football result prediction has gained lots of popularity in recent years due to sports betting markets. A manager’s tactics is now being used to develop a football match result predictive model by gathering the features that affect the outcome of football matches. Data extracted from site and their features (Attacking, Tackling, Technicality, Creativity and Defense) were used to compute the metric values of the prediction. Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm was used in prediction of team’s performance using false ‘9’ abilities to determine winning for the team. The system structure and the visible activities that take place within the system were also presented using appropriate design. The support vector machine system was implemented using Python as the software tool. The performance of the SVM is used to ascertain the level of accuracy of the prediction. Though many soccer predictive works have been done, this study was able to establish a prediction model using Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm for the evaluation of match winning considering false ‘9’ roles, which is the first predictive model from that angle/specific aspect of football prediction and was able to give a 97% accuracy. © 2022 NIPES Pub.

,On the time of corner kicks in soccer: an analysis of event history data,"To understand the patterns of times to corner kicks in soccer and how they are associated with a few important factors, we analyze the corner kick records from the 2019 regular season of the Chinese Super League. This paper is particularly concerned with the elapsed time to a corner kick from a natural starting point. We overcome 2 challenges arising from such time-to-event analyses, which have not been discussed in the sports analytics literature. The first is that observations of times to corner kicks are subject to right-censoring. A given soccer starting point rarely ends with a corner kick but the occurrence of a different terminal event. The second issue is the mixture feature of short and typical gap times to the next corner kick from a particular one. There is often a subsequent corner kick quickly following a corner kick. The conventional event time models are thus inappropriate for formulating distributions of corner kick times. Our analysis reveals how the timing of corner kicks is associated with the factors of first versus second half of the game, home versus away team, score differential, betting odds prior to the game, and red card differential. We present applications of the developed statistical model for prediction to support tactics and sports betting. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.",10.1007/s00180-024-01567-1,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85206814335&doi=10.1007%2fs00180-024-01567-1&partnerID=40&md5=9b393d1e939fbc8b78bca33568551329,SCOPUS,No,"Después de leerlo entero no solo el abstract, el paper no tiene mucha utilidad para nosotros ya que se cnetra en predecir el tiempo hasta el próximo corner",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Determinants of fast attack performance on match outcome in the elite women’s ice hockey,"The primary objective of this study was to discern the determinants affecting the ice hockey game based on the performance of the fast attack between the winning and losing teams. Data from the women’s ice hockey games at the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics (n = 28) were used. A total of 2011 fast attacks were recorded, which included winning team 1156 times and losing team 855 times. 29 variables from nine categories were involved and analysed using chi-square tests, univariate tests and binary logistic regression. As a result, that fast attack performance varies between winning and losing teams, Effective Offensive Play. Scoring Analysis of the 2005 World Championships and the 2006 Olympics, INT, DZ, OZ, one-timer, dekes, shooting zone 1, shooting zone 3, shooting zone 4, SOG, SG%, 2nd period, PK, are key variables in distinguishing the winner and loser (P<0.05). The predictive model shows that shooting zone 4 (OR = 0.824), one-timer (OR = 1.255), 2nd period (OR = 1.193), SOG (OR = 1.230), and SG% (OR = 1.170) are determining factors of game outcomes. The current information has important practical applications as it allows coaches and players to improve the tactical strategy and offensive efficiency of the game. © 2024 Tian, Xu.

,Prediction for NCAA championship,"In recent years, predicting sports results has become increasingly popular. Basketball is one of the most popular sports in the world, especially in USA, the NCAA game attract lot of fans around over 1000 colleges. In this paper, a new machine learning framework for predicting NCAA game results is proposed in order to find the features that affects NBA game results, and obtain the best model to predict the result of NCAA game. We wanted to determine whether the machine learning approach was applicable to predicting the result of NCAA game and what were the important factors that affected the result of the game. We proposed to use different machine learning models to predict the winner. Specifically, different classification models such as decision tree, random forest, LDA, QDA, SVM, Naïve bayes were used to predict the result. Then for each model, 10-fold cross validation was used to check the mean accuracies of each model and obtain the highest accuracy. By comparing the accuracies and performances of each model, we can obtain the best model for prediction and know which features affect the result of NCAA regular season and tourney season. For regular season, the LDA, QDA, random forest and SVM models show good performance and the accuracy is about 99%. For tourney season, LDA and SVM should be good models to do the prediction and the accuracy is about 90%. In general, LDA, random forest and SVM could be the convinced model in this case to predict the winner of NCAA basketball game, and there are some possibilities for improvement. Pruning the tree, different type of kernel of SVM such as linear, radial basis function, polynomial, and more classification models will be used in the future to predict the winner of NCAA games. © 2021 ACM.",10.1145/3505745.3505747,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85127211517&doi=10.1145%2f3505745.3505747&partnerID=40&md5=f4176b7aead5af0e5f8c7cf5aebc0832,SCOPUS,Si,,Accuracy,"Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVC, LDA, QDA, Naïve Bayes",Baloncesto,NCAA,masculino,No,"Limpieza de datos

Ivan,At risk: betting-related match-fixing in Brazilian football,"Brazilian football is strongly affected by betting-related match-fixing, as indicated by numerous incidents over the past years. However, little remains known about the underlying factors that contribute to the country’s vulnerability towards this form of corruption in sport. Hence, this study applies the lens of sociological institutionalism to examine some of the risk factors that make Brazilian football susceptible to betting-related match-fixing. An exploratory multi-methods study design was applied, including the analysis of policy and judicial documents and semi-structured interviews with key anti-match-fixing actors (n = 7) and sport actors (n = 15) in Brazilian football. Content analysis highlights the influence of deeply rooted characteristics and institutionalized norms in Brazilian football, such as a low prioritization of counteracting match-fixing, many unmonitored matches, poorly governed sport organizations, and poor working conditions for players and referees. In the end, this study helps to gain a better understanding of betting-related match-fixing in Latin America, while informing criminal policy to address and prevent this issue. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.",10.1007/s10611-021-09971-0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85106412732&doi=10.1007%2fs10611-021-09971-0&partnerID=40&md5=ac98e2bcc11a8aec0ae2bb3e43be5044,SCOPUS,No,Más amaños,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ivan,"Evaluative Language in sports: Crowds, coaches and commentators","Walsh, Caldwell and Jureidini offer an expansive linguistic perspective on the evaluative language prevalent in the world of professional sports. This book presents a close linguistic analysis of evaluative language in sport. Drawing on appraisal theory and data from three distinct sporting contexts - songs and chants in football stadiums, television commentary and coach discourse - it examines the critical role played by affectual, judgemental and appreciative language. In the spirit of sociolinguistics, this book also considers the history and culture of the respective sporting contexts. Connections are made between the evaluative language expressed by supporters, commentators and coaches and the invocation of power and solidarity. Evaluative Language in Sports gives insight into some of the key language practices that contribute to professional sports culture: a communal and combative world of winners and losers, 'us and 'them'.

Ivan,Prevalence of mental health symptoms among male and female Australian professional footballers,"Objective Determining the prevalence of mental health symptoms (MHS) among Australian professional footballers compared with former players. A secondary aim was to assess whether MHS were associated with recent injury and psychological resilience. Methods This cross-sectional study included 149 male (mean age: 24 years) and 132 female (mean age: 23 years) Australian A-League and W-League professional footballers (study group) and 81 former male footballers (control group, mean age: 39 years) for analysis. MHS and psychological resilience were assessed through validated questionnaires. Severe injuries were assessed through a single question. The adjusted Wald method was used to assess the primary aim. Logistic regression analyses was used to assess the secondary aim. Results The most prevalent MHS among active footballers and former footballers was sport-related psychological distress (63%) and alcohol misuse (69%), respectively. Global psychological distress, sleep disturbance, alcohol misuse and substance misuse were significantly lower among active male footballers than among former players. Increased psychological resilience among active male footballers was associated with a decrease in symptoms of sport-related and global psychological distress, anxiety and depression of 9%, 14%, 23% and 20%, respectively. Increased psychological resilience among female players was associated with 10% decrease in symptoms of depression. Problem gambling and sleep disturbance was associated with injury in the previous 6 months among active male and female footballers, respectively. Conclusions MHS are prevalent among active and former professional footballers. Higher level of psychological resilience is associated with decreased reporting of MHS. Severe injury is associated with problem gambling and sleep disturbance.  © ",10.1136/bmjsem-2021-001043,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85111681957&doi=10.1136%2fbmjsem-2021-001043&partnerID=40&md5=d442c907b728c36baf4971a23a7f51c1,SCOPUS,No,Es sobre salud mental,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ivan,Chronic Beetroot Juice Supplementation Accelerates Recovery Kinetics following Simulated Match Play in Soccer Players,"Objective: To assess the effect of beetroot juice (BET) on recovery kinetics of physical performance, muscle damage and perceived muscle soreness after simulated soccer match play in soccer players. Method: In a randomized, double-blind, crossover design, thirteen soccer players completed the Loughborough Intermittent Shuttle Test LIST. Players received either BET or placebo (PLA) (2*150) for 7 days (3 days pre-exercise, on the day trial, and 3 days post-exercise). Physical performance (Squat jump: SJ, countermovement jump: CMJ, maximal voluntary contraction: MVC, and 20 meters sprint: SP), blood markers of muscle damage (creatine kinase: CK, Lactate dehydrogenase: LDH), inflammatory parameter (C-reactive protein: CRP) and perceived muscle soreness (DOMS) were assessed at baseline, 0 h, 24 h, 48 h and 72 h following the exercise. Results: Following the LIST, a decrease was observed in CMJ, MVC and SP at 0 h, 24 h, 48 h in both conditions (p < 0.05). However, compared to PLA session, this decrease was significantly attenuated with BET for CMJ at 24 h and at 48 h and for MVC at 0 h, 24 h, 48 h and for SP at 48 h after the LIST (p < 0.05). Likewise, DOMS values were significantly lower with BET compared to PLA condition immediately and at 24 h after exercise.CK, LDH and CRP levels increased at 0 h and at 24 h post exercise in both conditions (p < 0.05), but without any significant difference between the two condition (p > 0.05). Conclusion: The results of the present study suggest that chronic beetroot juice supplementation reduces post exercise perceived muscle soreness and maintain better performance during the recovery period in soccer players. © 2020 American College of Nutrition.",10.1080/07315724.2020.1735571,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85080902545&doi=10.1080%2f07315724.2020.1735571&partnerID=40&md5=72d0db2b8508d14f63319ba4f0eaa638,SCOPUS,No,"Muy bueno el zumo, pero salvo que les demos zumo de poco nos va a servir",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ivan,Pre-game expected mental states in men’s mini-football teams: A comparative analysis,"The aim of the paper is to present empirical research on pre-game expected mental states of mini-football players by means of valid psycho-diagnostic instruments before and after a competition; to compare the empirical results of the winners and losers (n=448). The research methods: content-analysis, tests with standardized questionnaires, factor analysis ANOVA with Varimax rotation. Factor analysis was used to determine pre-game expected mental states of the mini-football players who won (n=178) and mental states of those athletes who lost the game (n=176), the empirical data on the drawn games were not processed (n=94). The structure of pre-game expected mental states of the winners was created. The main state in this structure is F1 “Value-sense selfregulation” (23.51%), related to F2 “Pragmatic self-regulation” (rs=.398; p≤.01) and F3 “Convergent selfregulation” (rs=.352; p≤.01). The structure of pre-game expected mental states of the athletes who lost the game was also created. The main mental state in this structure is F1 “Pragmatic-moderate self-regulation” (15.05%), related to F2 “Distant self-regulation” (rs=.394; p≤.01) and F3 “Sense-internal self-regulation” (rs=.322; p≤.01).We determined that the most stable correlations in the factor structure of pre-gameexpected mental states of the mini-football players who lost the game are F2 “Distant self-regulation” (F1, F3, F4, F5, F6 and F8). We maintain that this mental state is the biggest danger for an athlete and a team game. The study substantiates the importance of training staff’s ability to identify pre-game mental states of athletes and make efficient corrections before and in the course of a game. It describes content features of a regulatory function of athletes’ mental states in competition activities. There search proves that training staff’s ability to take into consideration pregame expected mental states of mini-football players and construct probable scenarios of the course of events allows reacting in time and change the course of a competition positively. The obtained results can be useful for training staff, sports managers, and everyone who is engaged in training and managing mini-football and football clubs, and also for researchers in psychology of physical education and sport. © JPES.",10.7752/jpes.2021.02096,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85104146497&doi=10.7752%2fjpes.2021.02096&partnerID=40&md5=ded6c1bb93fb91abe8ef9a43fbd9bd81,SCOPUS,No,Una vez más dirigido a psicología,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,NBA Game Result Prediction Using Feature Analysis and Machine Learning,"In the recent years, sports outcome prediction has gained popularity, as demonstrated by massive financial transactions in sports betting. One of the world’s popular sports that lures betting and attracts millions of fans worldwide is basketball, particularly the National Basketball Association (NBA) of the United States. This paper proposes a new intelligent machine learning framework for predicting the results of games played at the NBA by aiming to discover the influential features set that affects the outcomes of NBA games. We would like to identify whether machine learning methods are applicable to forecasting the outcome of an NBA game using historical data (previous games played), and what are the significant factors that affect the outcome of games. To achieve the objectives, several machine learning methods that utilise different learning schemes to derive the models, including Naïve Bayes, artificial neural network, and Decision Tree, are selected. By comparing the performance and the models derived against different features sets related to basketball games, we can discover the key features that contribute to better performance such as accuracy and efficiency of the prediction model. Based on the results analysis, the DRB (defensive rebounds) feature was chosen and was deemed as the most significant factor influencing the results of an NBA game. Furthermore, others crucial factors such as TPP (three-point percentage), FT (free throws made), and TRB (total rebounds) were also selected, which subsequently increased the model’s prediction accuracy rate by 2–4%. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",10.1007/s40745-018-00189-x,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85072724027&doi=10.1007%2fs40745-018-00189-x&partnerID=40&md5=e13ac8808fb15a71a7289d8f713786f1,SCOPUS,Si,,"Accuracy, Precision, F1 Score","Naïve Bayes, Red Neuronal, Logistic Model Tree (LMT)",Baloncesto,NBA,masculino,No,"Manejo de valores faltantes, discretización de variables, selección de características",430 partidos,"DRB (rebotes defensivos), TPP (porcentaje de triples), FT (tiros libres), FGP (porcentaje de tiros de campo), TRB (rebotes totales)",público,kaggle (no da más info),Predecir resultados,Victoria o Derrota,"Mejor modelo Logisctic Model Tree con 0.83 de precision

Ivan,Differences in performance indicators between winners and losers in senior inter county hurling championship,"Hurling is one of the oldest field sports in the world, yet little research has been conducted to develop our understanding of its game demands. This study aimed to create a profile of elite performance using data from three full seasons, and identify which performance indicators discriminate between winners and losers. A total of 77 Senior Inter County Hurling games (2018–2020) were analysed using NAC Sport Scout Plus, with all puckouts (5128), turnovers (6400) and shots (5695) coded. Paired sample t-tests and Wilcoxon signed rank testing were used to interrogate differences between winners and losers. Significant differences were identified in shooting indicators, with winning teams having higher total shot count (40), shot count from open play (29.5) and shot efficiency from both open play (61%) and dead balls (77%). There were significant differences in possession metrics; winners had a lower turnover rate (53%) and higher puckouts retention (65%), exhibiting higher overall productivity (3.8). These benchmark findings, and the detailed breakdown of puckout location and turnover type, will be of considerable interest to hurling coaches and analysts. © 2021 Cardiff Metropolitan University.",10.1080/24748668.2021.1932147,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85107389396&doi=10.1080%2f24748668.2021.1932147&partnerID=40&md5=dc8d033d0cf6d6a18a991a8e7b76c7ed,SCOPUS,No,No creo que los datos de county hurling sea lo que buscamos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ivan,Does the Game Matter? Analyzing Sponsorship Effectiveness and Message Personalization in Sport Live Broadcasts,"This study aims to increase the effective use of in-stadium sponsor message placement by analyzing the influence of various run-of-play characteristics on television viewers’ visual attention allocation. Sports broadcasts constitute one potential platform for sponsors to place personalized messages. However, literature still questions the effectiveness of in-stadium sponsor messages, and the influence of game-related factors on viewers’ visual attention has received little consideration in this context. In addition, researchers call for more reliable and realistic measures concerning the effective evaluation of sponsorship-linked marketing. Therefore, this study uses real-time adaptions (eye-tracking, in-play betting odds, etc.) utilizing live soccer broadcasts as one of the first. Data were analyzed second by second (n = 100,298) using generalized linear mixed models. Results indicate significant associations of several run-of-play characteristics with viewers’ visual attention to sponsor messages depending on the characteristic, the games’ degree of suspense, and playing time. Findings provide hands-on advice for practitioners to enhance sponsor message placement during live broadcasts. © 2023 The Authors.

Ivan,Radical feminist heroines: Gender philosophy in Joko Anwar’s three films,"This article discusses three films directed by Joko Anwar between 2015 and 2019: A Copy of My Mind (2015), Satan’s Slave (2017), and Impetigore (2019) within the context of gender philosophy to address the gender issues in the film. Joko Anwar is a well-known Indonesian director whose works are box-office hits and range from horror to drama, but typically feature marginalized members of society, especially women. Impetigore was the first horror film to receive Citra Award, the highest film award in the Indonesian film industry, as the best film of 2020. He was also the winner in the Best Director category based on the same film. These three films were chosen for qualitative analysis, as each features a major female character struggling against societal norms. This issue is examined by closely focusing on the films’ cinematography and mise-en-scène, including the shot types, camera angles, framing, and dialogue. The obtained findings reveal Joko Anwar’s gender philosophy that champions non-normative female characters willing to challenge the accepted norms and closely aligns with the concepts promoted by radical feminism. While his work emphasizes the universal value system of patriarchy as the source of oppression and subordination toward women, the main female protagonists’ performance continuously reproduces double meaning in the context of challenging patriarchal and societal norms. © 2024 The Author(s).

Ivan,A Content Analysis of Gambling Operators’ Twitter Accounts at the Start of the English Premier League Football Season,"The use of social media is now an established strategy to engage and maintain customer loyalty. The purpose of the present study was to examine the Twitter accounts of ten of the largest online sports betting operators in the UK to determine what marketing strategies were employed. More specifically, this study analyzed 3375 tweets posted by the operators during the opening weekend of the 2018–2019 English Premier League football season using a content analysis methodology. The results demonstrated that multiple strategies, including hashtags, were used to link gambling operator tweets with major sporting events, and the use of numerous promotional campaigns. Notably, over 90% of the tweets contained no responsible gambling information. The quantity and content of social media posts underline the need for a review of the current advertising regulations in the UK. Further research should examine how exposure to sports betting social media marketing influences gambling behavior. © 2019, The Author(s).",10.1007/s10899-019-09879-4,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85079563489&doi=10.1007%2fs10899-019-09879-4&partnerID=40&md5=3900fd1c6fc256446ae5f83599fa3b16,SCOPUS,No,Esto es de sociología,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ivan,Increasing role of three-point field goals in national basketball association,"Introduction. Since introduction of three-point field goal NBA teams have used this shot more frequently and nowadays it is inseparable part of teams’ game plan in basketball. The increasing role of three-point shot is recently topic of many conversation around basketball. Aim of Study. The purpose of this study was to examine if the growth of the role of three-point shots in the NBA is statistically significant, to find out the reason for that growth and whether three-point field goal attempts have an impact on result of basketball games. Material and Methods. Statistical data concerning three-point field goal attempts over the course of 15 most recent NBA regular seasons were collected and used in analysis. Increasing role of three-point shot was examined by original method, using 3PA/FGA coefficient which measures the frequency of three-point field goal attempts in all field goal attempts. Statistical calculations were carried out using STATISTICA software package. Results. Statistically significant differences in frequency of three-point field goal attempts between seasons taken in consideration were revealed by Friedman’s ANOVA. Results also showed that the biggest increase of frequency of three-point shots was between 2015/16 and 2016/17 seasons after the most successful regular season in NBA history by Golden State Warriors. Conclusions. Three-point field goal became one of the most important part of basketball and its role has increased over the years. Nowadays ability to shoot from beyond the arc is crucial as lack of this ability decreases number of options in offensive tactic by any team. Even though three-point field goal is not the most important factor in determining winner of basketball game, it has significant impact on result of basketball games. © 2020, University School of Physical Education.

Materials and methods. The study involved male combat athletes (n = 78) of the Russian national team; mean age – 25.2 (21.5–28.9) years, mean body weight – 76.9 (68.4–83.4) kg. The following biochemical and immunological laboratory tests were performed: urea content, transaminase activity – ALT, AST, creatine kinase – CK, testosterone, cortisol levels and their ratio, absolute and relative CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, CD16+, CD19+ lymphocytes, immunoregulatory index – CD4+/CD8+, phagocytosis, IgA, IgM, IgG, IgE. The subjects were divided into two groups with respect to athletic performance: the UHA group (ultra-high achievements) included Olympic, World and European champions and medal winners (n = 19), the MNT group involved national team members (n = 59). Results. A multifactorial assessment of the relationship between athletic performance and biochemical/immunological blood parameters showed two biomarkers of predictive importance: urea up to 5.75 mM/l (sensitivity – 73.3%, specificity – 68.7%) and absolute CD4+ count – 0.865·109/l (sensitivity – 81.3%, specificity – 59%); decreased serum urea and increased circulating CD4+ cells were associated with outstanding athletic performance typical of the UHA group. The simultaneous use of both markers and their reference values improves the predictive accuracy for the UHA group by 3 times compared to a single use of absolute CD4+ count. The odds ratios were 24 (95% CI 6.23– 2.5, p < 0.001) and 8.147 (95% CI 2.121–31.3, p = 0.001), respectively. Conclusion. Serum urea up to 5.75 mmol/l as the most important indicator of protein metabolism and circulating CD4+ count of > 0.865·109/l as a factor of immune performance demonstrate the ability to better tolerate training and competitive loads and resist infections. © 2022 South Ural State University - Institute of Sport, Tourism and Service.

Ivan,"Who is the GOAT (Greatest of All Time) Formula One Racer—Hamilton, Schumacher, Verstappen, Vettel, or Some Other Driver, Perhaps Fangio? Statistical Analyses Provide Answers and Information for Game Designers","The debate about who is the GOAT (the “Greatest Of All Time”) is not restricted to Formula One competition. There are several possible criteria, other than the number of World Championships won. We approach this issue of attempting to identify the GOAT (assuming that there is only one), by looking at the race performance of 12 drivers who participated in Grand Prix races since 1950. (a) Unquestionably, the more race participation, the greater the chance of accumulating wins and therefore improving a driver’s ranking towards being the GOAT. (b) A similar line of argument occurs for the ranking via podiums. (c) The system of awarding points for ranks after the race has changed five times since 1950. Comparing points accrued by different drivers therefore necessitates reassigning points to achieve comparability. We also consider how rankings change if other point systems are used. (d) Bayesian statistical analysis allows not only the evaluation of who is eligible for GOAT without using a point system (via Beta and Dirichlet distributions) but can also estimate the probability that two contenders’ performances differ only by chance. Formula One also takes place in video games, particularly in tournaments. Here we provide evidence that avoiding point systems to identify winners of the tournament is advisable. We provide suspense by not revealing who is the GOAT in this Abstract. We provide the names of one or several GOATs (there might be several) in this publication. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.",10.1007/978-3-031-60692-2_6,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85195882414&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-031-60692-2_6&partnerID=40&md5=57f55f806a8cd733976e1869e260be56,SCOPUS,No,"Intersante, pero no buscamos sacar el mejor, sino predecir",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ivan,Almost a lottery: the influence of team strength on success in penalty shootouts,"Three aspects of penalty shootouts that have not been examined in the literature so far are 1) the influence of overall team strength on penalty success, 2) the viability of a forecasting model for penalty shootouts, and 3) the existence of a penalty-specific home advantage. To this end, a sample consisting of 1067 penalty shootouts from 14 cup competitions was investigated. Team strength was estimated based on betting odds and results show that stronger teams win significantly more shootouts compared to weaker teams. A forecasting model, based on an out-of-sample approach, suggests that the effect of team strength on success is rather small as the winning probability remains around 40% even for very weak teams against very strong teams. Thus, for weaker teams it seems advantageous to focus on drawing a game against stronger teams as their probability of success is much greater during a penalty shootout compared to normal game play. In contrast to the robust evidence of a home advantage during normal game play the results further indicate an absence for a home (or away) advantage during penalty shootouts. The results presented are therefore highly valuable for coaches in supporting clear tactical recommendations. © 2020 Cardiff Metropolitan University.",10.1080/24748668.2020.1799171,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088968652&doi=10.1080%2f24748668.2020.1799171&partnerID=40&md5=f3fb8cc2a065c369d85ec0260ad06f65,SCOPUS,No,Ya sabemos que los penalits permiten ganar a un equipo más pequeño,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ivan,Why are major sports events trapped in the winner's curse? A case study of the 2017 World Road Cycling Championship,"Purpose: This paper sought to determine how a major sport event can become trapped in a winner's curse, in which the fierce competition to host the event forces organisers to spend more on acquiring and hosting it than what it is worth in economic terms. Design/methodology/approach: This study used a combination of document analysis and 47 in-depth interviews with 51 individuals representing various private and public organisations involved in the implementation of the UCI 2017 Road Cycling World Championship. Snowball sampling and a semi-structured interview guide were used to ensure coverage of all relevant information. Findings: The organiser and the host municipal lacked the necessary experience with events of this size and character. Information from previous championships events was not transferred, and the municipality administration did not utilise experiences from hosting previous events. Limited financial resources prevented the organiser from hiring enough employees with the necessary competence. Lack of communication between the stakeholders who contributed in hosting the event reduced the quality of planning and preparations. A dubious culture and lack of seriousness within the Norwegian Cycling Federation, which was the owner of organising company, seemed to have been transferred to organiser. Originality/value: The research identifies some of the reasons why major sports events so often turns out to be more problematic than expected in economic terms, not only for the organiser but also for actors in the public sector in the host city. The novelty is that it goes into depth on the underlying reasons and the dynamic forces behind these problems. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.",10.1108/SBM-12-2020-0132,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85120461066&doi=10.1108%2fSBM-12-2020-0132&partnerID=40&md5=3ed590e16abf510e9547f34b342cdd67,SCOPUS,No,Tiene que ver con la organizacion de eventos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ivan,Vision-Based Machine Learning in Robot Soccer,"Robots need to perceive their environment in order to properly interact with it. In the RoboCup Soccer Middle Size League (MSL) this happens primarily through cameras mounted on the robots. Machine Learning can be used to extract relevant features from camera imagery. The real-time analysis of camera data is a challenge for both traditional and Machine Learning algorithms, since all computations in the MSL have to be performed on the robot itself. This contribution shows that it is possible to process camera imagery in real-time using Machine Learning. It does this by presenting the current state of Machine Learning in MSL and providing two examples that won the Scientific and Technical Challenges at RoboCup 2021. Both examples focus on semantic detection of objects and humans in imagery. The Scientific Challenge winner presents how YOLOv5 can be used for object detection in the MSL. The Technical Challenge winner demonstrates how to improve interaction between robots and humans in soccer using OpenPose.

The aim of this study was to prove the hypothesis that biochemical changes could influence the outcome of competitions. In this study, β-endorphin was evaluated as an indicator of analgesia, lactate as an indicator of fatigue and cortisol as an indicator of stress in the first two horses and the last ones that cross the finish line. This study was performed on 44 horses participating in the 1000-meter national championship. In Group 1, 22 winners and second place horses were included; for Group 2, 22 last and penultimate horses were included. Blood samples were obtained in the doping room after race (T0) and 20 minutes after finishing (T20). Results for beta endorphin at T0 and T20 were higher (P > 0.05) for Group 1 compared to Group 2; on the contrary, lactate concentration was lower (P > 0.05) for Group 1 than Group 2 at T0 and T20. However, differences (P < 0.05) were obtained within groups at T0 and T20 for beta endorphin and lactate concentrations. No significant differences were found for cortisol concentration.The results of this study showed that winning horses had higher levels of β-endorphin and lower levels of lactate than losers. Further and deeper experimental studies are needed to prove the hypothesis that biochemical changes could influence the outcome of competitions. © 2021",10.1016/j.jevs.2021.103857,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85122267477&doi=10.1016%2fj.jevs.2021.103857&partnerID=40&md5=557e716f9695c483beb9a5664436ea0b,SCOPUS,No,"Como no lo hagamos sobre caballos y tengamos de antemano la informacion de sus endorfinas, no nos sirve de mucho",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ivan,Accumulators and Bookmaker’s Capital with Perturbed Stochastic Processes,"The sports betting industry has been growing at a phenomenal rate and has many similarities to the financial market in that a payout is made contingent on an outcome of an event. Despite this, there has been little to no mathematical focus on the potential ruin of bookmakers. In this paper, the expected profit of a bookmaker and probability of multiple soccer matches are observed via Dirac notations and Feynman’s path calculations. Furthermore, we take the unforeseen circumstances into account by subjecting the betting process to more uncertainty. A perturbed betting process, set by modifying the conventional stochastic process, is handled to scale and manage this uncertainty. © 2022 by the authors.",10.3390/appliedmath2020010,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85201593011&doi=10.3390%2fappliedmath2020010&partnerID=40&md5=81634a113b03246e79f9e56492158cae,SCOPUS,No,"Proceso estocástico de la economía de un bookmaker, no es lo que buscamos",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ivan,Gambling adverts in live TV coverage of the Qatar 2022 FIFA Men’s World Cup,"Background: Gambling marketing is ubiquitous in UK football and, despite gambling industry self-regulation such as the whistle-to-whistle ban, remains prominent in live TV coverage. Major international tournaments do not usually feature gambling pitch-side advertising and shirt sponsorship, increasing the importance of TV adverts during these high-profile competitions. The present study examined the prevalence and features of gambling adverts shown during the commercial broadcaster ITV’s live coverage of games in the 2022 Qatar World Cup. Method: Each match shown live on ITV was recorded. For each gambling advert, the timing of the advert (pre-/during-/post-match), the advert category (financial inducements/live odds/safer gambling/brand awareness) and safer gambling messaging were recorded. Results: Over the 30 matches analyzed, there were 156 adverts directly for gambling brands or products (M = 5.2, range 3–8), featuring adverts from eight different operators. The majority of adverts were shown pre-match (80.8%). Financial inducements were most commonly advertised (42.3%), followed by brand awareness adverts (26.9%). The safer gambling message ‘take time to think’ was shown in 70.5% of adverts. Adverts for lottery products did not feature any safer gambling messages. Conclusions: Multiple gambling adverts were shown during each match of the 2022 Qatar World Cup, especially so pre-match. Pre-match adverts predominantly encourage viewers to gamble promptly, through financial inducements and boosted live odds. Any potential further legislation could therefore consider either further restrictions based on the entire broadcast, or by enforcing the use of specific safer gambling messages. © 2023 The Author(s).

Ivan,Sex differences in professional padel players: analysis across four seasons,"Despite the growth of research on padel, available literature is mainly focused on male samples of modest size. This study characterised the differences in performance between men’s and women’s top-class padel players competing in the World Padel Tour (WPT) across four entire seasons (2016–19). Game performance indications from 1070 sets (532 matches) were collected from the official WPT website records. Men and women’s performance were compared by means of the set result and the season. Men padel players performed a smaller number of actions, winners and errors per game than women, except winning smashes and smashes, by order of effect size (ES) magnitude: winning smashes (ES = 1.27), smashes (ES = 1.26), unforced errors (ES = 0.59), winners (ES = 0.55), breakpoints won (ES = 0.42), breakpoints (ES = 0.41) and winning volleys (ES = 0.24). Additionally, sex differences in unforced errors, winners, breakpoints, and breakpoints won become bigger as the time goes, with men showing an increasing greater performance. These findings confirm the existence of sex differences in professional padel performance and a worrying trend to becoming bigger. The sex specificities should be considered to both optimise training and competition plans and mitigated these sex disparities in padel players. © 2021 Cardiff Metropolitan University.",10.1080/24748668.2021.1930363,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85113496860&doi=10.1080%2f24748668.2021.1930363&partnerID=40&md5=6e06801adf79923ba32269abc87138ce,SCOPUS,No,Es sobre las diferencias entre hombres y mujeres en padel,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ivan,Age behaviour and variables of success in FIFA World Cup from 1998 to 2018; [Comportamiento de la edad y variables de éxito en la Copa Mundial de la FIFA desde 1998 hasta 2018],"This study aimed to analyse the influence of age on variables such as the number of participations, club confederation, national team confederation, playing position, team performance, year celebration, and total minutes played during FIFA World Cup (FWC) from 1998 to 2018. The sample was composed of all players who participated in the FWC from 1998 to 2018 and played at least one minute (n = 3529). Data were examined using descriptive analysis, a one-way ANOVA, and linear regression. The main finding of the current study was that the average age of participants in the FWC was 26 years, with goalkeepers and central defenders being the playing positions with the highest average age while wingers have the lowest average age. The youngest players belong to CAF clubs and national teams, while the oldest players belong to CONCACAF. Finally, the players who completed a higher percentage of minutes have a higher average age (26.5 years), while the winners (25.4 years) have a lower average age than the finalists (26.9 years). These results provide useful information regarding at what age players reach their peak performance and could provide valuable information to national federations and national team coaching staff. © Copyright: Federación Española de Asociaciones de Docentes de Educación Física (FEADEF).",10.47197/retos.v50.99719,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85173492883&doi=10.47197%2fretos.v50.99719&partnerID=40&md5=2b31a084eb6edd7e94b9d973eed21f16,SCOPUS,No,"Sabemos que la edad sería un parámetro a tener en cuenta, pero no creo que todo este estudio sea necesario",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ivan,Sports Betting and Depression among Youths in the South-South Region of Nigeria,"BACKGROUND: It has been noted that those addicted to gambling are at a high risk of developing mental health problems such as depression. AIMS: This study was designed to determine the effect of participating in sports betting on depression of young people in Nigeria. METHODS: This study adopted a cross-sectional respondent-driven approach to study 286 youths who have engaged in sports betting in Nigeria, using Yenagoa city in Bayelsa State as a case study from September to November 2020. Primary data for this study was sourced mainly through the use of a questionnaire, while data collected from the field was analysed using descriptive and bivariate statistics. RESULTS: Findings from the study indicated that the mean age of the respondents was 23 years. Also, the two main types of sports betting were live football and virtual football matches. The study again, revealed that majority of the respondents patronised Betking and Bet9ja as their major sports betting centre. It was also found that there is a significant association between sport betting and depression among youths (X2 = 71.188); estimated amount placed per gamble and depression (X2 = 168.338); length of time of engagement in sport betting and depression (X2 = 165.553); number of time engaged in sport betting per month and depression (X2 = 41.875); football leagues bet on and depression (X2 = 41.223); device used in sports betting and depression (X2 = 71.188); and gambling firms used and depression (X2 = 71.188). CONCLUSIONS: The study concluded that there is a need for proper sensitisation of youths on the best practices of engaging in sports betting, while more emphasis is laid on initiating youth empowerment programmes in the South-South region. © 2023, Sdruzeni SCAN.

Ivan,Detrimental Industries’ Sponsorship in Football Clubs Across Ten Major Leagues from 2000–2022: A Retrospective Study,"Background: Sponsorship of football teams by detrimental industries may negatively impact fans’ dietary and behavioral choices. The study aimed to determine the proportion of sponsors on the jerseys of teams in the top ten football leagues that comprise companies producing alcohol or unhealthy food, or engaging in gambling. Methods: We conducted a retrospective study, incorporating data from first-division football teams in 10 countries (Argentina, Brazil, England, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, the Netherlands, Spain, and the United States) playing from 2000–2022. Data were collected on the primary sponsors displayed on team jerseys and categorized into alcohol, unhealthy food (defined as producers of ultra-processed food according to the NOVA classification), gambling, or other, based on the nature of the products or services offered by the sponsors. We performed descriptive statistical analyses and multivariate linear regression analyses. Results: A total of 4452 sponsorship records were analyzed. The majority were classified as “other” (81.8%), followed by gambling (6.9%), alcohol (2.6%), and unhealthy food (2.6%). We did not identify any sponsor representing the tobacco industry. The prevalence of gambling sponsors surged from 1.7% in 2000 to 16.3% in 2022. Conversely, alcohol-related sponsorships dwindled from 6.2% in 2000 to 1.0% in 2022. In the multivariate linear regression model, these trends were statistically significant. The alcohol industry remained visible in the Spanish league. Conclusions: A significant proportion of sponsorships on the jerseys of top football teams across the world represents alcohol, ultra-processed food, or the gambling industry. Trends in the types of sponsors on the jerseys of leading football clubs across the Western world are diverse. Particularly concerning is the recent increase in the percentage of clubs sponsored by the gambling industry. To limit the detrimental effects of the promotion of unhealthy products, novel policies should be considered. © 2024 by the authors.",10.3390/nu16213606,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85208414609&doi=10.3390%2fnu16213606&partnerID=40&md5=4a8443961937476ab90cdc08a022967a,SCOPUS,No,Es sobre la publicidad que se expone,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ivan,A stochastic model for NFL games and point spread assessment,"Statistical modelling of sports data is indispensable to analyse the sports behaviour and apprehend significant inferences that are helpful to adopt decisive strategies before or during the sports events. This paper introduces a stochastic model as the distribution of difference derived from the Bivariate Affine-Linear Exponential distribution. The distribution of difference is first ever used to model the margin of victory that provides an adequate fitting on the observed data. A simulation study is carried out to observe the stability of the model parameters through their average estimated values, biases, standard errors, root mean square errors and confidence intervals. The performance of the proposed model is examined by applying it on the real data of the National Football League and comparing the results with those of the existing models. Finally, the quantile function of the proposed distribution is used to assess the possible range of point spreads for winning the bet in a particular game. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",10.1080/02664763.2022.2120973,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85138227692&doi=10.1080%2f02664763.2022.2120973&partnerID=40&md5=962d7fa9438a15685902ca52e41e23e1,SCOPUS,No,"Puede ser interesante pero nosotros lo estamos enfocando de otra manera, no como un proceso estocástico",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The focus surrounds the distribution of wealth and financial disparity between clubs in the English football system leading to overspending and potential insolvency. We consider the impact of broadcast rights distribution, solidarity payments and parachute payments and provide strategic direction for a collective recovery. The intention is to stimulate discussion and analysis on how football governing bodies can use the COVID-19 pandemic to reset the finances of English football. Such discussion provides a more balanced, competitive suite of competitions that tackle financial inequality and put aside self-interest.

Ivan,Comparing the healthy development of youth Australian Rules Footballers across talent development and community settings,"Objectives This study aimed to compare talent development athletes to community-level athletes in Australian Rules Football across various markers of healthy youth development. Methods Survey data were collected from 363 youth athletes (126 women, 232 men, 5 not reported; Mage=18.69 years, SDage=2.62 years, age range 16–25 years) playing Australian Rules Football at a talent development (recruited from Australian Football League Talent Pathway, n=220) or community (n=143) level. Measures included markers of physical health (eg, general health, risk-taking behaviours), psychological and emotional well-being (eg, mental health symptoms, life satisfaction), family and social relationships (eg, social support, relationship status), educational and occupational attainment/engagement (eg, career satisfaction, education), ethical behaviour (eg, moral self-image), civic engagement, life skills (eg, self-mastery, coping), and demographics. Results Based on regression models, relative to community-level athletes, talent development athletes reported better physical health (d=0.51), lower injury rates (OR=0.50) and less problematic drug use (d=−0.46). Talent development athletes also reported better psychological and emotional well-being, evidenced by lower stress (d=−0.30), higher life satisfaction (d=0.47) and less problematic gambling (d=−0.34). Additionally, talent development athletes reported higher family support (d=0.49), lower likelihood of poor educational outcomes (less than expected educational stage; OR=0.37), lower intention to complete less than year 12 education (OR=0.18), higher career satisfaction (d=0.42), higher self-mastery (d=0.37) and higher perfectionistic striving (d=0.59). Conclusion Findings demonstrate markers of healthier development within talent development athletes relative to community athlete peers. Investment in community-level sports may be warranted to improve healthy development. However, further causal evidence is required. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2024.",10.1136/bmjsem-2023-001799,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85193283116&doi=10.1136%2fbmjsem-2023-001799&partnerID=40&md5=9d080cdcd07cba994420c65d059164be,SCOPUS,No,Esto no tiene que ver,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ivan,Professional boxing analysis with T-Patterns,"Identifying performance indicators in professional boxing trough T-pattern analysis (TPA) was a priority objective of the present study. We accessed data through the boxrec.com portal, where 15 boxing fights were selected. All these fights concluded in the first or second round and belonged to champions (lb. for lb.) of international organizations recognized in professional boxing. The boxers' interactive decisions were approached through an observational methodology. For the conformation and behavioral record, a mixed registration system was agreed upon by two former exprofessional boxers. The data were analyzed through Theme (TPA) to reveal differences relating to the outcome (Winner vs Loser), in terms of temporal regularities and number of occurrences through Chi-square (χ2). More percentages of individual T-Patterns were found in winners than in losers, and winning boxers showed greater decisional complexity than the losers. However, these differences between both groups of boxers were not supported by Chi-square (χ2). © 2021",10.1016/j.physbeh.2021.113329,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85100060386&doi=10.1016%2fj.physbeh.2021.113329&partnerID=40&md5=013df9e54220f7bfcf673dfb7ef10595,SCOPUS,No,"No vamos a usar boxeo, además no veo nada de información útil",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ivan,A simple and flexible Bayesian method for inferring step changes in cognition,"Human behavioral data often show patterns of sudden change over time. Sometimes the causes of these step changes are internal, such as learning curves changing abruptly when a learner implements a new rule. Sometimes the cause is external, such as people’s opinions about a topic changing in response to a new relevant event. Detecting change points in sequences of binary data is a basic statistical problem with many existing solutions, but these solutions rarely seem to be used in psychological modeling. We develop a simple and flexible Bayesian approach to modeling step changes in cognition, implemented as a graphical model in JAGS. The model is able to infer how many change points are justified by the data, as well as the locations of the change points. The basic model is also easily extended to include latent-mixture and hierarchical structures, allowing it to be tailored to specific cognitive modeling problems. We demonstrate the adequacy of this basic model by applying it to the classic Lindisfarne scribes problem, and the flexibility of the modeling approach is demonstrated through two new applications. The first involves a latent-mixture model to determine whether individuals learn categories incrementally or in discrete stages. The second involves a hierarchical model of crowd-sourced predictions about the winner of the US National Football League’s Most Valuable Player for the 2016–2017 season. © 2018, Psychonomic Society, Inc.",10.3758/s13428-018-1087-7,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85052129945&doi=10.3758%2fs13428-018-1087-7&partnerID=40&md5=f20cd55e8321d1ebc805db7a1150d234,SCOPUS,No,No tiene que ver,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ivan,To be a champion of the 24-h ultramarathon race. If not the heart … mosaic theory?,"This comprehensive case analysis aimed to identify the features enabling a runner to achieve championship in 24-h ultramarathon (UM) races. A 36-year-old, multiple medalist of the World Championships in 24-h running, was assessed before, one and 10 days after a 24-h run. Results of his extensive laboratory and cardiological diagnostics with transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and a one-time cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) were analyzed. After 12 h of running (approximately 130 km), the athlete experienced an increasing pain in the right knee. His baseline clinical data were within the normal range. High physical efficiency in CPET (VO2max 63 mL/kg/min) was similar to the average achieved by other ultramarathoners who had significantly worse results. Thus, we also performed genetic tests and assessed his psychological profile, body composition, and markers of physical and mental stress (serotonin, cortisol, epinephrine, prolactin, testosterone, and luteinizing hormone). The athlete had a mtDNA haplogroup H (HV0a1 subgroup, belonging to the HV cluster), characteristic of athletes with the highest endurance. Psychological studies have shown high and very high intensity of the properties of individual scales of the tools used mental resilience (62–100% depending on the scale), openness to experience (10th sten), coherence (10th sten), positive perfectionism (100%) and overall hope for success score (10th sten). The athlete himself considers the commitment and mental support of his team to be a significant factor of his success. Body composition assessment (%fat 13.9) and the level of stress markers were unremarkable. The tested athlete showed a number of features of the champions of ultramarathon runs, such as: inborn predispositions, mental traits, level of training, and resistance to pain. However, none of these features are reserved exclusively for “champions”. Team support’s participation cannot be underestimated. The factors that guarantee the success of this elite 24-h UM runner go far beyond physiological and psychological explanations. Further studies are needed to identify individual elements of the putative “mosaic theory of being a champion”. © 2021 by the authors.

Ivan,Brain endurance training improves soccer-specific technical skills and cognitive performance in fatigued professional soccer players,"Objectives: Brain Endurance Training (BET) — the addition of mentally fatiguing cognitive tasks to standard physical training — could improve performance in soccer. We tested whether BET, with cognitive tasks intermixed with physical training activities, improved players' cognitive and soccer-specific technical performance compared to physical training alone when fresh and fatigued. Design: The study employed a pre/training/midtest/training/posttest design. Methods: 31 professional male soccer players were randomly assigned to BET or control groups and completed 18 physical training sessions over 6 weeks. In between the physical training activities, the BET group completed demanding cognitive tasks, whereas the control group rested. Players completed the Loughborough soccer passing (LSPT) and shooting test (LSST) before and after completing a 30-min Stroop task. A brief psychomotor vigilance test (PVT-B), a visual analog rating of mental fatigue (MF-VAS), and rating of perceived exertion (RPE) were measured during testing and training. Results: During testing, the 30-min Stroop task elicited a state of MF, confirmed by higher subjective ratings (P < .01). Compared to pre-testing, at mid- and post-testing, the BET group improved passing (all P < .01), shooting (all P < .01), and PVT-B performance (all P < .01) when tested after (fatigued) but not before (fresh) the Stroop task, whereas the control group did not change performance either way. During training the BET group reported higher MF (P < .01) and exhibited slower PVT-B responses (P < .01) compared to control. Conclusions: Intermixed BET was more effective than physical training alone at improving cognitive and soccer-specific technical performance of professional soccer players when fatigued. © 2024 The Authors",10.1016/j.jsams.2024.08.203,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85202971752&doi=10.1016%2fj.jsams.2024.08.203&partnerID=40&md5=4c3338269d103c68df214fd2e3b632ae,SCOPUS,No,Biología,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ivan,A large-scale exploratory study of android sports apps in the google play store,"Context: Prior studies on mobile app analysis often analyze apps across different categories or focus on a small set of apps within a category. These studies either provide general insights for an entire app store which consists of millions of apps, or provide specific insights for a small set of apps. However, a single app category can often contain tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of apps. For example, according to AppBrain, there are 46,625 apps in the “Sports” category of Google Play apps. Analyzing such a targeted category of apps can provide more specific insights than analyzing apps across categories while still benefiting many app developers interested in the category. Objective: This work aims to study a large number of apps from a single category (i.e., the sports category). Our work can provide two folds contributions: 1) identifying insights that are specific to tens of thousands of sports apps, and 2) providing empirical evidence on the benefits of analyzing apps in a specific category. Method: We perform an empirical study on over two thousand sports apps in the Google Play Store. We study the characteristics of these apps (e.g., their targeted sports types and main functionalities) through manual analysis, the topics in the user review through topic modeling, as well as the aspects that contribute to the negative opinions of users through analysis of user ratings and sentiment. Results: We identified sports apps that cover 16 sports types (e.g., Football, Cricket, Baseball) and 15 main functionalities (e.g., Betting, Betting Tips, Training, Tracking). We also extracted 14 topics from the user reviews, among which three are specific to sports apps (accuracy of prediction, up-to-dateness, and precision of tools). Finally, we observed that users are mainly complaining about the advertisements and quality (e.g., bugs, content quality, streaming quality) of sports apps. Conclusion: It is concluded that analyzing a targeted category of apps (e.g., sports apps) can provide more specific insights than analyzing apps across different categories while still being relevant for a large number (e.g., tens of thousands) of apps. Besides, as a rapid-growing and competitive market, sports apps provide rich opportunities for future research, for example, to study the integration of data science or machine learning techniques in software applications or to study the factors that influence the competitiveness of the apps. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.infsof.2023.107321,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85171436865&doi=10.1016%2fj.infsof.2023.107321&partnerID=40&md5=00de6a77d7e0f82c7ebb44ab736166da,SCOPUS,No,"Es sobre aplicaciones en la play store, no tiene relación",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ivan,World Heavyweight Championship boxing: The past 30+ years of the male division,"Data from the past 30+ years of the male boxing World Heavyweight Championship (n = 182 bouts) was obtained. The USA were the most represented and produced more champions than any other nation, followed by the UK, Ukraine and Russia. Denmark (100%), Ukraine (85.4%) and the UK (67.3%) produced the greatest 'success rates' in World Heavyweight Championship contests. Where possible, comparisons between bout winners and losers were also made. Winners were significantly taller (p < 0.001, d = 0.35) and had a greater reach (p = 0.003, d = 0.23) when compared to losers. Championship bouts were settled by the following methods: A form of knockout (101), points decision (57), retirement (14), draw (3), disqualification (3), technical decision (1), whilst 3 no contests were omitted from the analysis. Total punches thrown and landed, and jabs and power punches thrown and landed were consistently significantly greater (p < 0.005, d = 0.27-0.73) in winners, compared to losers. Winners were more accurate compared to their losing counterparts by - 8 percentage points. The data presented in the present study clearly show some anthropometric advantages of championship bout winners, compared to their unsuccessful counterparts, and that winners are more active and accurate when compared to losers. The punch output data, albeit very basic, may be useful in informing tactical strategy and preparation of heavyweight prospects. Likewise, the data in the present study may be an interesting resource for professional boxing enthusiasts. Future research should seek to replicate the analysis in the present study across other weight divisions to explore any potential differences between weight classes. Additionally, extending the analysis to female boxing may provide interesting comparisons. © 2022 Mitchell James Finlay.

Ivan,"Ranking in Incomplete Tournaments: The Generalized Win Percentage Method, Efficiency, and NCAA Football","I present a parsimonious family of scoring methods for ranking teams in incomplete tournaments. It is especially useful if teams play different number of games. I show that this family of scoring methods satisfies common sense theoretical properties studied by the literature on paired comparisons. I analyze it in terms of efficiency, defined as how close a scoring method comes to capturing what the teams’ win percentages would have been, in a complete tournament. Finally, using data on betting odds, I calibrate the family of scoring methods to match, as closely as possible, the actual rankings that were used to determine the teams that would go on to compete for the championship of the NCAA division 1 football tournament between 2011 and 2023. I find that the rankings used by the NCAA were generally efficient and I quantify the biases present in each year’s ranking. © The Author(s) 2024.",10.1177/15270025241268738,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85208052480&doi=10.1177%2f15270025241268738&partnerID=40&md5=fce3216877cc419c4011386d7f2deb77,SCOPUS,No,"Es sobre como rankear equipos en torneos incompletos, se ha filtrado solo porque usa los betting ods",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,Informational efficiency and behaviour within in-play prediction markets,"Studies of financial market informational efficiency have proven burdensome in practice, because it is difficult to pinpoint when news breaks and is known by some or all the participants. We overcome this by designing a framework to detect mispricing, test informational efficiency and evaluate the behavioural biases within high-frequency prediction markets. We demonstrate this using betting exchange data for association football, exploiting the moment when the first goal is scored in a match as major news that breaks cleanly. There are pre-match and in-play mispricing and inefficiency in these markets, explained by reverse favourite-longshot bias (favourite bias). The mispricing tends to increase when the major news is a surprise, such as a goal scored by a longshot team late in a match, with the market underestimating their chances of going on to win These results suggest that, even in prediction markets with large crowds of participants trading state-contingent claims, significant informational inefficiency and behavioural biases can be reflected in prices. © 2021 International Institute of Forecasters",10.1016/j.ijforecast.2021.05.012,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85109112446&doi=10.1016%2fj.ijforecast.2021.05.012&partnerID=40&md5=6bbc6aaf0d49a11bd6ed787d305db305,SCOPUS,Si,,"T tests, ROI, p-valor","f-tests, Regression, ""Weighted Least Squares (WLS),""",Fútbol,premiere league,masculino,Sí,,,"pre-event

,Anthropometric Variability of European Taekwondo Champions; [Variabilidad Antropométrica de los Campeones Europeos de Taekwondo],"World Taekwondo (WT) as an Olympic sport gained much more attention than before, and there is a growing need for precise and specific profiles of successful taekwondo competitors. Aim of this investigation was to determine body composition, somatotype, and selected anthropometric parameters/indexes of elite taekwondo champions and medal winners on the most demanding taekwondo tournaments in the World. The sample for this research consisted of n=16 (n=4 male; n=12 female) elite taekwondo champions, n=8 juniors and n=8 seniors, who were European (n=13), and World (n=3) champions of European descent. Data was collected longitudinally for seven years since 2015. Obtained results revealed specific (absolute) phenotype of taekwondo champions, following: PI (11.50 female; 11.85 male), HWR (43.96 female; 44.47 male) and BMI (19.96 female; 22.04 male). Further analysis shows that champions have greater values of body height, and have slightly greater ectomorphy and mesomorphy values in regard to other elite competitors. Presented research is the first publication of referent values for the general anthropometric dataset, and such results represent the anthropometric variability of European WT champions. © 2023, Universidad de la Frontera.

,How do Bookmakers Interpret Running Performance of Teams in Previous Games? Evidence From the Football Bundesliga,"This study examines how running performance (intensive runs, total distance covered) of football teams in previous games impacts betting markets as it relates to expected win probability. Theoretically, bookmakers could interpret team’s running performance as effort or fatigue, with sports science studies suggesting that distance covered reflects effort and intensive runs signal fatigue. Using data from the 2011/12-2018/19 seasons of the German Bundesliga, beta regression models reveal that bookmakers interpret team’s running performance in previous games contrary to physiological explanations in sports sciences. Tests of market efficiency incorporating these findings do not find a profitable betting strategy for bettors. © The Author(s) 2020.",10.1177/1527002520975827,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85096623350&doi=10.1177%2f1527002520975827&partnerID=40&md5=493f8a078ecf684498858e79f84d651b,SCOPUS,Si,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,The impact of weather on betting outcomes and market behaviour in the NCAA football totals market,"Sports betting markets are an attractive setting to evaluate the degree to which publicly available information is efficiently incorporated into asset prices. Weather information represents one category of potentially undervalued public data, and we assess its impact on wagering outcomes and market behaviour in American college football. We uncover statistically significant effects of weather characteristics on totals market outcomes, indicating that the market does not appropriately assimilate this data into its forecasts. We also demonstrate that weather characteristics are not statistically significant predictors of totals market line movement magnitude. Together, these results suggest the market systematically undervalues weather data. We then develop simple wagering strategies utilizing only three weather characteristics and illustrate the ability to profit. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",10.1080/13504851.2022.2146651,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85142275321&doi=10.1080%2f13504851.2022.2146651&partnerID=40&md5=98a3b29084af210da32408853a0974f8,SCOPUS,Si,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Modelling dependence in football match outcomes: Traditional assumptions and an alternative proposal,"The approaches routinely used to model the outcomes of football matches are characterized by strong assumptions about the dependence between the number of goals scored by the two competing teams and their marginal distribution. In this work, we argue that the assumptions traditionally made are not always based on solid arguments. Although most of these assumptions have been relaxed in the recent literature, the model introduced by Dixon and Coles in 1997 still represents a point of reference in the betting industry. While maintaining its conceptual simplicity, alternatives based on modelling the conditional distributions allow for the specification of more comprehensive dependence structures. In view of this, we propose a straightforward modification of the usual Poisson marginal models by means of thoroughly chosen marginal and conditional distributions. Careful model validation is provided, and a real data application involving five European leagues is conducted. The novel dependence structure allows to extract key insights on league dynamics and presents practical gains in several betting scenarios. © 2024 The Author(s).",10.1177/1471082X241238802,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85193511509&doi=10.1177%2f1471082X241238802&partnerID=40&md5=82127ddde75eda13de69821255bdf4d4,SCOPUS,Si,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Using convolutional neural network and candlestick representation to predict sports match outcomes,"The interdisciplinary nature of sports and the presence of various systemic and non-systemic factors introduce challenges in predicting sports match outcomes using a single disciplinary approach. In contrast to previous studies that use sports performance metrics and statistical models, this study is the first to apply a deep learning approach in financial time series modeling to predict sports match outcomes. The proposed approach has two main components: a convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier for implicit pattern recognition and a logistic regression model for match outcome judgment. First, the raw data used in the prediction are derived from the betting market odds and actual scores of each game, which are transformed into sports candlesticks. Second, CNN is used to classify the candlesticks time series on a graphical basis. To this end, the original 1D time series are encoded into 2D matrix images using Gramian angular field and are then fed into the CNN classifier. In this way, the winning probability of each matchup team can be derived based on historically implied behavioral patterns. Third, to further consider the differences between strong and weak teams, the CNN classifier adjusts the probability of winning the match by using the logistic regression model and then makes a final judgment regarding the match outcome. We empirically test this approach using 18,944 National Football League game data spanning 32 years and find that using the individual historical data of each team in the CNN classifier for pattern recognition is better than using the data of all teams. The CNN in conjunction with the logistic regression judgment model outperforms the CNN in conjunction with SVM, Naïve Bayes, Adaboost, J48, and random forest, and its accuracy surpasses that of betting market prediction. © 2021 by the author.

,Effect of scoring first in finals of UEFA champions league and UEFA Europe league; [Efecto de marcar primero en la final de la UEFA Champions League y la UEFA Europa League],"The objectives of this research were: i) to study the effect of scoring first on the final result of the match; ii) to compare the effect of scoring first, the total goals, the goal scoring period, and scoring minute of the first goal (winner and loser) in the finals of both competitions; and iii) to analyse the evolution of these variables throughout history. The sample consisted of all the single-match, neutral-field finals (N = 78) played over the history of the UEFA Champions League (UCL) and UEFA Europa League (UEL) European competitions. The team scoring first had 75.6% probabilities of winning. When analysing the effect of scoring first, the results showed no statistically significant differences between the two competitions, although they become significant in regard to the evolution of the scoring first effect throughout the UCL history, in favour of the finals played within 1950s and 1960s (X2 = 14.15, p <.05). As a conclusion, the effect of scoring first in a continental final is decisive because any team leading the scoreboard has major chances of winning. In this sense, technical staff at clubs should use this information to work on the training and propose strategies that allow them to go out onto the pitch with the clear intention of scoring first. © Federación Española de Asociaciones de Docentes de Educación Física (FEADEF) ISSN: Edición impresa: 1579-1726.

,Influence of Red and Yellow cards on team performance in elite soccer,"The aim of the current study is to analyze the effects of red and yellow cards on the scoring rate in elite soccer. The sample was composed of 1826 matches in the top five European leagues. All events were structured in 5-min intervals and were analyzed by means of a Generalized Linear Mixed Model with Poisson distribution, considering the presence of correlated data, where the dependent variable is represented by scoring rate. Team strength and home advantage were considered implicitly by means of a transformation of the betting odds for each game. The model also took into account the goal difference and time evolution. Overall, we found that after a sending off, each team’s scoring rate changes significantly, damaging the penalised team and favouring its opponent. When the player who is sent off belongs to the Away team, the impact of a red card is more or less maintained over time intervals. The red card effect, on the other hand, tends to fade over time when the affected team is stronger. The relative difference in scoring rates is also affected by the goal difference and the difference in booked players, being slightly lower for the team going ahead if it has more booked players. Our approach allows estimating the expected cumulative soring rate through time for various red card scenarios. Particularly if a red card is given with 30 min of remaining time, the expected impact is 0.39 goals if the guilty player is on the visiting team and 0.50 if he plays for the home team. Coaches and analysts could use this information to establish objectives for players and teams in training and matches and to be prepared for these very different scenarios of numerical superiority or inferiority. © 2022, The Author(s).",10.1007/s10479-022-04733-0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85130106776&doi=10.1007%2fs10479-022-04733-0&partnerID=40&md5=7cadae7ff3301bab430e3213fe0735b2,SCOPUS,Si,Puede ser util en real time betting,"RMSE, AIC, Pseudo AIC, p-valor","Distribucion Poisson, Generalized Linear Model",Fútbol,"liga española, premiere league, Serie A, Bundesliga",masculino,Sí,,"1826 de las 5 grandes ligas, eventos cada 5 minutos => 73,040 observaciones","Home advantage, Win odds, period, injury time. clock time, interval duration, goal, goal diff, yellow dif, red dif, superiority time",público,https://www.football-data.co.uk/,Analizar el efecto que tiene las tarjetas amarillas y rojas en el resultado de los partidos,scoring rate,"Mayor impacto de tarjeta roja en equipo visitante,  mas siginificativo si la expulsión se produce antes de 30 minutos del final",,2017/18,,Enfoque interesante al tratar el tema de la influencia de las expulsiones en los resultdos de los partidos.,"Centrado en una única temporada que hace que se reduzca los datos de entrada

,The weakest link: a novel use of network analysis for the broken passing links in football,"Background: Understanding passing connectivity in football is a critical component of team performance assessment. Many studies have examined successful passing via network analysis; however, no research has attempted to understand the broken passing connections as a network in football. Method: In a first of its kind study, we assessed a teams’ unsuccessful or ‘broken’ passing links using network analysis. The analysis used the 2018 UEFA Champions League final between Real Madrid and Liverpool. The broken passing links were identified and analysed using network analysis to determine team and individual network characteristics. Results: Eventual winners Real Madrid had fewer players involved in the broken passing links network, compared to Liverpool. The analysis also highlights the individual contributions, in terms of passers and intended recipients within the broken passing links network. Discussion: This short communication study has demonstrated a novel use of network analysis to analyse the broken passing networks in football. This extension to the utility of network analysis in football could be used as a tool for coaches and match analysts to understand team and opposition performance. Further research is recommended to test the method across multiple games, levels of competition, and pitch location, of the broken passing links. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",10.1080/24733938.2018.1562277,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85061108070&doi=10.1080%2f24733938.2018.1562277&partnerID=40&md5=4d6b9d411382c75b52856e61260c4fbc,SCOPUS,Si,Es sobre analizar los pases desde el punto de vista de redes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Predicting Football Match Outcomes With Machine Learning Approaches,"The increasing use of data-driven approaches has led to the development of models to predict football match outcomes. However, predicting match outcomes accurately remains a challenge due to the sport’s inherent unpredictability. In this study, we have investigated the usage of different machine learning models in predicting the outcome of English Premier League matches. We assessed the performance of random forest, logistic regression, linear support vector classifier and extreme gradient boosting models for binary and multiclass classification. These models are trained with datasets obtained using different sampling techniques. The result showed that the models performed better when trained with dataset obtained using a balanced sampling technique for binary classification. Additionally, the models’ predictions were evaluated by conducting simulation on football betting profits based on the 2022-2023 EPL season. The model achieved the highest accuracy is the binary class random forest, but the model provided the highest football betting profit is the binary class logistic regression. © 2023, Brno University of Technology.

,Analysis of discriminatory game variables between winners and losers in women’s handball world championships from 2007 to 2017,"The aim of this study was to identify game variables that discriminated winning from losing teams and to understand how these variables contributed to victory by observing goal differences in matches of the women’s handball world championships. The sample comprised 471 WCh’s games played between 2007 and 2017. The games were grouped into three clusters: balanced games – difference of 1-8 goals; unbalanced games – difference of 9-20 goals; and very unbalanced games – difference of > 20 goals. Generally, the performance of winning teams was significantly higher (in most variables), or lower in the case of the number of technical faults (p<.05). In the balanced games, there was a greater contribution of defensive variables (stolen balls, blocked throws, and goalkeeper’s efficiency indicators) in relation to attack variables (attack efficiency and throw efficiency indicators). For victory, the number of technical faults reduce the chances of winning. Games with the unbalanced and very unbalanced goal differences seem to follow the same tendency; however, in the very unbalanced games, there were more assists, yellow cards and 2-min suspensions. We concluded that the decisive variables for victory in the balanced games showed a greater weight, with a special emphasis on stolen balls followed by offensive variables (throw efficiency indicators, attack efficiency, and technical faults). There was an equal tendency for the games with the unbalanced and very unbalanced outcomes. © 2020, University of Zagreb - Faculty of Kinesiology.

,Integration of machine learning XGBoost and SHAP models for NBA game outcome prediction and quantitative analysis methodology,"This study investigated the application of artificial intelligence in real-time prediction of professional basketball games, identifying the variations within performance indicators that are critical in determining the outcomes of the games. Utilizing games data from the NBA seasons 2021 to 2023 as the sample, the study constructed a real-time predictive model for NBA game outcomes, integrating the machine learning XGBoost and SHAP algorithms. The model simulated the prediction of game outcomes at different time of games and effectively quantified the analysis of key factors that influenced game outcomes. The study’s results demonstrated that the XGBoost algorithm was highly effective in predicting NBA game outcomes. Key performance indicators such as field goal percentage, defensive rebounds, and turnovers were consistently related to the outcomes at all times during the game. In the first half of the game, assists were a key indicator affecting the outcome of the game. In the second half of the games, offensive rebounds and three-point shooting percentage were key indicators affecting the outcome of the games. The performance of the real-time prediction model for NBA game outcomes, which integrates machine learning XGBoost and SHAP algorithms, is found to be excellent and highly interpretable. By quantifying the factors that determine victory, it is able to provide significant decision support for coaches in arranging tactical strategies on the court. Moreover, the study provides reliable data references for sports bettors, athletes, club managers, and sponsors. © 2024 Ouyang et al.

Javier,Defining the esports bettor: evidence from an online panel survey of emerging adults,"Competitive video gaming (esports) is a growing multi-national, billion-dollar industry. Esports cultures replicate traditional sports cultures, involving elite athletes, teams, league sponsorships, large viewing audiences, high profile leagues and championships, and opportunities to bet on outcomes. However, little is known about people who bet on esports, it is generally considered a niche practice. Using data from the Emerging Adults Gambling Study, a non-probability survey of 3549 people aged 16–24 living in Great Britain, the profile of esports bettors was compared with those who bet on other sports and non-gamblers. Those who bet on esports were more likely to be male, to be from nonwhite ethnic groups, to be heavily involved in playing digital games themselves, and to have higher rates of gambling involvement and problem gambling. Multivariate analysis showed a strong relationship between engaging in gambling-like practices within digital games and esports betting (for example, the purchase of loot boxes for money, or betting skins on external websites). Frequency of playing digital games was not associated with esports betting, suggesting it is not how often someone engages with digital games that is correlated with esports betting, but rather the different type of practices they undertake when playing video games. © 2020 The Author(s).

Javier,Differences in kinematic and match-play demands between elite winning and losing wheelchair padel players,"We aimed to compare the match-play and kinematic demands of the translation and rotation movements of elite wheelchair padel players as a function of match results. Twenty-two elite male players were video-analysed with a two-dimensional direct linear transformation (DLT) -corrected video system across seven matches of a professional tournament. Distance, turns, changes of direction, linear and angular speed, acceleration and the players' heart rate (HR) were recorded. Losing couples in wheelchair padel covered greater distances than winners (P <0.001; r =0.024) and did so at a higher speed (P <0.001;r =0.06), while making greater efforts by accelerating (P <0.001; null = -0.021), braking (P <0.001; null = -0.014), and remaining less time stationary (P <0.001; null =0.059). In addition, losers performed more turns per rally (P <0.001;r= 0.04) at a faster speed, greater angular accelerations(P <0.001; V =0.06) and greater average (P= 0.007;d= 0.91) and maximum (P= 0.20;d= 0.69) HR values. These data suggest that winner couples performed a better court positioning and employed a strategy to move the opponent during rallies in order to avoid them optimally reaching the ball.",10.1371/journal.pone.0233475,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0233475,WOS,No,diferencias entre jugadores de padel en silla de ruedas,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Javier,Analysis of economic factors of Iranian professional football,"The objective of this study was to analyze the economic factors of Iranian professional football. The participants comprised experts specializing in football and sports economics. The purposive sampling method was employed to identify participants for the research. A total of 12 individuals were selected as the statistical sample. Data analysis was conducted using the Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP). In the paired comparison questionnaire, participants were asked to assess the relative importance of the economy components. ExpertChoice software was utilized to calculate component weights. The findings revealed that it would be recommendable to depoliticize the football administrative and management system and minimize government interference. Additionally, fostering a tax culture and formulating a provincial tax system tailored to the specific characteristics of football is crucial.

Javier,Hierarchical Multimodal Attention for Deep Video Summarization,"The way people consume sports on TV has drastically evolved in the last years, particularly under the combined effects of the legalization of sport betting and the huge increase of sport analytics. Several companies are nowadays sending observers in the stadiums to collect live data of all the events happening on the field during the match. Those data contain meaningful information providing a very detailed description of all the actions occurring during the match to feed the coaches and staff, the fans, the viewers, and the gamblers. Exploiting all these data, sport broadcasters want to generate extra content such as match highlights, match summaries, players and teams analytics, etc., to appeal subscribers. This paper explores the problem of summarizing professional soccer matches as automatically as possible using both the aforementioned event-stream data collected from the field and the content broadcasted on TV. We have designed an architecture, introducing first (1) a Multiple Instance Learning method that takes into account the sequential dependency among events and then (2) a hierarchical multimodal attention layer that grasps the importance of each event in an action. We evaluate our approach on matches from two professional European soccer leagues, showing its capability to identify the best actions for automatic summarization by comparing with real summaries made by human operators.",10.1109/ICPR48806.2021.9413097,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9413097,IEEE,No,Arquitectura para hacer resumenes automáticos de partidos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Javier,Detecting patterns in the behaviour of goalkeepers and kickers in the penalty shootout: a between-gender comparison among score situations,"There is plenty of research on penalty kicking in men's soccer, with a focus on either the goalkeeper or the penalty taker. Yet women's soccer and their playing behaviour are under-represented in research. The current study was designed to examine gender differences in the choice patterns of expert kickers and goalkeepers during penalty shooting in relation to the previously documented right-oriented bias. Using videos of penalties from shootouts at the highest level of men's and women's international soccer, we recorded the goalkeeper's dive direction and accurately measured the location of the ball as it crossed the goal line. We created a map of all kicks and their outcomes (goal, no goal, off-target). Our mapping procedure allowed us to use alternative definitions for the goal centre width and to extract the corresponding kick distribution between right, centre and left. In addition to analysing the potential right-oriented bias in women goalies' behaviour, we also analysed the joint distribution of kickers' and goalkeepers' choices for each score situation (behind, tied, or ahead). Our findings indicate that the goalkeepers' general tendency was to dive more often to the right, while the kickers' tendency was to shoot to the right of the goalies. Moreover, this latter tendency of kicking to the goalies' right was found to be stronger among the female kickers. Finally, our analysis refutes the claim that goalkeepers exhibit a detrimental right-oriented bias, with this conclusion being even stronger among female goalies.",10.1080/1612197X.2022.2066704,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1612197X.2022.2066704,WOS,No,Patrones de lanzamiento de penaltis en futbol tanto en hombres como en mujeres,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Javier,Profiling Actions for Sport Video Summarization: An attention signal analysis,"Currently, in broadcast companies many human operators select which actions should belong to the summary based on multiple rules they have built upon their own experience using different sources of information. These rules define the different profiles of actions of interest that help the operator to generate better customized summaries. Most of these profiles do not directly rely on broadcast video content but rather exploit metadata describing the course of the match. In this paper, we show how the signals produced by the attention layer of a recurrent neural network can be seen as a learned representation of these action profiles and provide a new tool to support operators' work. The results in soccer matches show the capacity of our approach to transfer knowledge between datasets from different broadcasting companies, from different leagues, and the ability of the attention layer to learn meaningful action profiles.",10.1109/MMSP48831.2020.9287062,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9287062,IEEE,No,Analisis de diferentes señales para crear resumenes de partidos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Javier,Football Culture and Domestic Violence: Dissecting the Link among a Focus Group of Non-Abusive Youth Football Fan's,"Increased reports of domestic violence and abuse (DVA) have been identified following football games. Yet, the relationship between DVA and football culture remains qualitatively underexplored. To better understand this phenomenon, we conducted a focus group with male, non-abusive football youth fans to gain their perceptions of why domestic violence increases following football matches in England. Using thematic analysis, we present a unique insight into the link between DVA and football culture. The findings align with previously identified risk factors for DVA, including the role of alcohol consumption, gambling, and other violent behaviours. We also identified game-specific (e.g., the intensity of winning or losing) and individual factors (e.g., previous exposure to violence and awareness of what constitutes DVA) as heightening the effects of these cultural behaviours, alongside an increased sense of identity with 'football culture' after attending a game. We conclude by considering the implications of these findings for policy and practice, such as considering placement of advertising campaigns during matches to increase awareness, increasing threats of punishment and considering the scheduling of matches to reduce triggers of such cultural, and often violent, behaviours associated with football fandom. In addition, we call for further research in this area.",10.3390/youth3030069,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/youth3030069,WOS,No,Cultura del futbol y violencia doméstica,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our analysis covers 103 broadcasts in the United States from February 2017 to February 2021 for Premier Boxing Champions (FOX) and Top Rank Boxing (ESPN). Using a generalized linear model, we estimate a demand function for basic cable broadcasts and place specific emphasis on adopting alternative measures of outcome uncertainty. We find no evidence that increasing balance between boxers increases viewership figures on basic cable broadcasts. Consistent with pay-per-view boxing viewership, our results demonstrate that bout quality impacts demand for cable broadcasts. Furthermore, we find no evidence of a declining viewership trend, a finding relevant to the industry given the general decrease in viewership trends for main events and pay-per-view broadcasts.

,Forecasting college football game outcomes using modern modeling techniques,"There are many reasons why data scientists and fans of college football would want to forecast the outcome of games - gambling, game preparation and academic research, for example. As advanced statistical methods become more readily accessible, so do the opportunities to develop robust forecasting models. Using data from the 2011 to 2014 seasons, we implemented a variety of advanced modeling techniques to determine which best forecasts the outcome of games. These methods included ridge regression, the lasso, the elastic net, neural networks, random forests, k-nearest neighbors, stochastic gradient boosting, and a Bayesian regression model. To evaluate the efficacy of the proposed models, we tested them on data from the 2015 season. The top performers - lasso regression, a Bayesian regression with team-specific variances, stochastic gradient boosting, and random forests - predicted the correct outcome over 70% of the time, and the lasso model proved most accurate at predicting win-loss outcomes in the 2015 test data set.",10.3233/JSA-190314,http://dx.doi.org/10.3233/JSA-190314,WOS,Si,Predecir resultados futbol americano universitario utilizando metodos estadísticos avanzados,"RMSE, Accuracy","KNN, Ridge Regression, Lasso, Bayesian Linear Model, Red Neuronal, Elastic Net",Fútbol Americano,NCAA,masculino,No,"Eliminación de partidos con equipos de divisiones menos importantes por ausencia de historial completo de partidos

Javier,Toward a Better Understanding of Fantasy Football and Dehumanization of Athletes: Is Fantasy Sport Gambling to Blame?,"A growing amount of attention has been paid to the topic of dehumanization of professional athletes. Fantasy sport has been explored as a driver of this phenomenon, but empirical evidence has yet to be provided. This research explores the role of gambling-that is, whether fantasy participants were more driven by money or entertainment/escape-in this phenomenon. Results of SEM analysis indicated that fantasy football partic-ipation motivated by gambling was positively associated with dehumanization, while participation for the purpose of entertainment/escape was negatively related. This suggests it is not fantasy sport in itself that is a predictor of dehumanization but rather participation motivated by gambling. In addition to extending the literature on dehumanization amongst fantasy participants, the research provides guidance for fantasy sport service providers' game terminology while also informing the potential role of fantasy sport in proliferating the inability for sport fans to understand mental health struggles amongst athletes.",10.32731/SMQ.314.1222.04,http://dx.doi.org/10.32731/SMQ.314.1222.04,WOS,No,Jugadores de ligas fantasy y deshumanización de los atletias,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Efficiency of online football betting markets,"This paper evaluates the efficiency of online betting markets for European (association) football leagues. The existing literature shows mixed empirical evidence regarding the degree to which betting markets are efficient. We propose a forecast-based approach for formally testing the efficiency of online betting markets. By considering the odds proposed by 41 bookmakers on 11 European major leagues over the last 11 years, we find evidence of differing degrees of efficiency among markets. We show that, if the best odds are selected across bookmakers, eight markets are efficient while three show inefficiencies that imply profit opportunities for bettors. In particular, our approach allows the estimation of the odds thresholds that could be used to set profitable betting strategies both ex post and ex ante. © 2018 International Institute of Forecasters",10.1016/j.ijforecast.2018.07.008,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054131534&doi=10.1016%2fj.ijforecast.2018.07.008&partnerID=40&md5=14d8f71f0ff4bdad31822b3498e97763,SCOPUS,Si,eficiencia de mercados de apuestas para encontrar oportunidades de beneficio en apuestas.,"p-valor, Weighted Least Squares (WLS), Ramsey’s  RESET test, Market Efficiency curve, Error prediccion Mercado","Linear Regression - OLS (Ordinary Least Squares), Analisis Estadistico, ""Weighted Least Squares (WLS),""",Fútbol,"liga española, premiere league, liga turca, Liga griega, Bundesliga, Serie A, Ligue 1(francia), Liga escocesa, Liga Portuguesa, Liga Holandesa, Liga Belga",masculino,Sí,,"33,060 partidos",,público,"www.

Javier,Machine Learning Models Reveal Key Performance Metrics of Football Players to Win Matches in Qatar Stars League,"As football (soccer) is one of the most popular sports worldwide, winning football matches is becoming an essential aspect of football clubs. In this study, we analyzed football players’ performance in a total of 864 football matches of the Qatar Stars League (QSL) between the years 2012 and 2019. For each match, the collective performance of the players in key playing positions was analyzed to understand their effectiveness in winning games. We formulated this study as a classification framework in the machine learning (ML) context to distinguish the winning team from the losing team in a match. This allowed us to check the effectiveness of different performance metrics considered a feature vector for ML models. Different ML models were considered for this classification task, and the logistic regression-based model was considered the best performing model, with more than 80% accuracy. Multiple feature selection methods were leveraged to identify players’ performance metrics that could be considered as contributing factors to determine the match result. The proposed ML model identified several features, including (a) shots on target by forwarders (b) distance covered by forwarders and midfielders at very high speed (c) successful passes, that can be considered as effective performance metrics for winning a football match in QSL. Interestingly, we revealed that the defenders’ role could not be ignored for match results, and playing fair games improves the chance of winning matches in QSL. We also showed that players’ performance metrics from the last five seasons would provide sufficient discriminative power to the proposed ML model to predict the match-winner in the upcoming season. The proposed ML model will support the players, coaching staff, and team management to focus on specific performance metrics that may lead to winning a match in QSL.",10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3038601,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9261335,IEEE,No,Metricas de rendimiento clave que dan lugar a victorias en la QSL,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,Predicting score difference versus score total in rugby and soccer,"A common paradigm is used to show that, in rugby and soccer, score difference is more accurately predicted based on past data than is score total. Offensive and defensive ratings evolve by applying least-squares or exponential smoothing to past home scores and visiting scores, corrected for home advantage. Smoothed ratings provide a first-order prediction of score difference and score total for future matches. The average absolute error of such predictions may be minimized by employing a ‘shrinking factor’ L. If L is one, predictions are based solely on smoothed past performances. If L is zero, all predicted score differences are zero and all predicted score totals equal the average total score of past matches. L between one and zero shrinks predicted score difference towards zero and predicted score total towards average total score. Based on more than 3000 games contested in rugby union (Zurich/Guinness Premiership and Super 12/14) and soccer (English Premier League and Italian Serie A), L for score difference was more than that for score total. Thus, past performance was a better predictor of score difference than score total. It is suggested that a team focuses strategy on score difference (to win or draw) while score total is of no strategic interest, thus affecting prediction based on past data. Based on an evaluation of more than 2000 games, it was concluded that betting on score total is undesirable in contrast to score difference because of a relatively small number of possible bets and an unreliable profit.",10.1093/imaman/dpn021,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8132444,IEEE,Si,Mayor eficiencia a la hora de predecir la diferencia de goles en rugby y futbol y además mejor en el caso de las apuestas por reduccion de incertidumbre,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Javier,Using statistics to detect match fixing in sport,"Match fixing is a growing threat to the integrity of sport, facilitated by new online in-play betting markets sufficiently liquid to allow substantial profits to be made from manipulating an event. Screens to detect a fix employ in-play forecasting models whose predictions are compared in real-time with observed betting odds on websites around the world. Suspicions arise where model odds and market odds diverge. We provide real examples of monitoring for football and tennis matches and describe how suspicious matches are investigated by analysts before a final assessment of how likely it was that a fix took place is made. Results from monitoring driven by this application of forensic statistics have been accepted as primary evidence at cases in the Court of Arbitration for Sport, leading more sports outside football and tennis to adopt this approach to detecting and preventing manipulation.",10.1093/imaman/dpz008,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/imaman/dpz008,WOS,Podría Ser,Estadística para detectar amaños de partidos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Javier,Solving Imperfect Information Poker Games Using Monte Carlo Search and POMDP Models,"Recent advances achieved in the field of reinforcement learning have led AI algorithms capable of beating world champions in some perfect information games like Chess and Go. However, the AI approach to imperfect information games (such as Poker) is much more difficult because the complexities in estimating hidden information and behaviors of opponents may become extremely challenging. Since Markov Decision Process (MDP) is the underlying mathematical model of reinforcement learning with perfect information games, Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) deserves research attention for studying the games with imperfect information. In this paper, we study a 16-cards Rhode Island Hold'em poker game and present a POMDP model to formulate this imperfect information extensive game. Based on the POMDP model, we use Bayesian approach to estimate the opponent's hand and transform the original problem to several perfect information games. Furthermore, to handle the challenge of explosively huge storage space and computation burdens, we develop a Monte Carlo optimization algorithm to estimate the action values of the POMDP model. Finally, we conduct numerical experiments in the Rhode Island Hold'em poker game to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.",10.1109/DDCLS49620.2020.9275053,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9275053,IEEE,No,Modelos para vencer en juegos de información imperfecta como el poker,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Javier,Exploring Convolution Neural Network for Branch Prediction,"Recently, there have been significant advances in deep neural networks (DNNs) and they have shown distinctive performance in speech recognition, natural language processing, and image recognition. In this paper, we explore DNNs to push the limit for branch prediction. We treat branch prediction as a classification problem and employ both deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs), ranging from LeNet to ResNet-50, and deep belief network (DBN) for branch prediction. We compare the effectiveness of DNNs with the state-of-the-art branch predictors, including the perceptron, our prior work, Multi-poTAGE+SC, and MTAGE+SC branch predictors. The last two are the most recent winners of championship branch prediction (CBP) contests. Several interesting observations emerged from our study. First, for branch prediction, the DNNs outperform the perceptron model as high as 60-80%. Second, we analyze the impact of the depth of CNNs (i.e., number of convolutional layers and pooling layers) on the misprediction rates. The results confirm that deeper CNN structures can lead to lower misprediction rates. Third, the DBN could outperform our prior work, but not outperform the state-of-the-art TAGE-like branch predictor; the ResNet-50 could not only outperform our prior work, but also the Multi-poTAGE+SC and MTAGE+SC. © 2013 IEEE.",10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3017196,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85090774643&doi=10.1109%2fACCESS.2020.3017196&partnerID=40&md5=4d55a37a0da3575d5246a5a8b5726a7b,SCOPUS,No,Redes convolucionales para branch prediction,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Javier,Analysing Hawk-Eye ball-tracking data to explore successful serving and returning strategies at Wimbledon,"Investigations of elite tennis match-play have highlighted the importance of serving and returning strategies. This study establishes the most common and effective strategies used by male and female players at Wimbledon, and identifies associated winner-loser differences. Hawk-Eye ball-tracking data from 302 men’s and 139 women’s singles matches contested between 2016 and 2018 were analysed using confidence intervals, Chi-square and Chi-square partitions. For both sexes, first serves to lateral areas (Zones A and D) of the service boxes were more common and more successful than first serves to central areas (Zones B and C). Second serves to lateral areas also tended to be more successful than those to central areas, but players typically prioritised safety, often executing second serves to Zone C (central, but towards the backhand of right-handed opponents). Men and women hit more serve-returns to central areas than lateral areas of the court, despite serve-returns to lateral areas being more successful. Furthermore, winning male players were more accurate than losing male players, executing a comparatively higher percentage of serves and returns to lateral areas; winning female players demonstrated this on first serves only. These findings can be used to improve the specificity and representativeness of players’ grass court training. © 2023 The Author(s).

Javier,Detectability of Sports Betting Anomalies Using Deep Learning-based ResNet: Utilization of K-League Data in South Korea,"Background. Sports match-fixing refers to the act of pre-determining the results of a game. Match-fixing fundamentally undermines competition in sports, and it harms society as a whole. Match-fixing has large as it is conducted as a secret transaction. Consequently, finding evidence regarding this illegal activity or detecting it is difficult. Therefore, a system should be built to detect match-fixing to prevent it. Objectives. This study aims to detect betting anomalies in sports events through dividend graphs. Methods. We collected the odds data for the K-League from 2010 to 2020 and converted the data into graph images to generate 3101 graph images. The collected data was analyzed using ResNet to classify them into normal games (2,464 games) and abnormal games (637 games) based on an image classification method. The ResNet model was trained for 100 epochs, and as a result, values below 0.05 were derived as the loss values of the training and test data, respectively. Results. After performing the validation with the test data of 50 normal and 27 abnormal games, it was found that the accuracy in deriving normal games was 90%. Furthermore, match-fixing games were derived with an accuracy of 74.1%. Therefore, the model was accurate for 65 out of 77 games, showing that the model’s accuracy was 84.44%. Conclusion. The results demonstrate the model’s value as a method for detecting sports match-fixing. Additionally, it can aid in eradicating sports match-fixing by providing the basic data for undertaking detailed match-fixing investigations. © (2023), (Asian Exercise and Sport Science Association).

Javier,"Salivary oxytocin, cognitive anxiety and self-confidence in pre-competition athletes","It is well known that soccer sport has the potential for high levels of stress and anxiety and that these are linked to Cortisol (C) variations. To date, much research has been devoted to understanding how Oxytocin (OT) can affect anxiety in response to a challenge. The aim of this study was to investigate, in 56 young male soccer players, the psychophysiological stress response 96 and 24 h before one soccer match of a tournament, in order to establish whether athletes who won or lost, show different levels of C and OT or expressions of competitive state anxiety subcomponents. We found that winners had significantly lower Cognitive anxiety and higher Self-confidence scores than losers. Also, significant differences between winners and losers in C and OT concentrations were observed, with higher OT levels in who has won and higher C levels in who has lost. Our results showed interesting associations between OT, C, anxiety feelings, and the outcome of competition. © 2021, The Author(s).",10.1038/s41598-021-96392-7,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85113195691&doi=10.1038%2fs41598-021-96392-7&partnerID=40&md5=3a74e5a6604267338389d6a73d0b2c9b,SCOPUS,No,Analisis de diferentes marcadores en atletias previos a la competicion,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Javier,MGMT promoter methylation prediction based on multiparametric MRI via vision graph neural network,"Purpose: Glioblastoma (GBM) is aggressive and malignant. The methylation status of the O6‐methylguanine‐DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter in GBM tissue is considered an important biomarker for developing the most effective treatment plan. Although the standard method for assessing the MGMT promoter methylation status is via bisulfite modification and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequencing of biopsy or surgical specimens, a secondary automated method based on medical imaging may improve the efficiency and accuracy of those tests. Approach: We propose a deep vision graph neural network (ViG) using multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to predict the MGMT promoter methylation status noninvasively. Our model was compared to the RSNA radiogenomic classification winners. The dataset includes 583 usable patient cases. Combinations of MRI sequences were compared. Our multi-sequence fusion strategy was compared with those using single MR sequences. Results: Our best model [Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR), T1-weighted pre-contrast (T1w), T2-weighted (T2)] outperformed the winning models with a test area under the curve (AUC) of 0.628, an accuracy of 0.632, a precision of 0.646, a recall of 0.677, a specificity of 0.581, and an F1 score of 0.661. Compared to the winning models with single MR sequences, our ViG utilizing fused-MRI showed a significant improvement statistically in AUC scores, which are FLAIR (p ¼ 0.042), T1w (p ¼ 0.017), T1wCE (p ¼ 0.001), and T2 (p ¼ 0.018). Conclusions: Our model is superior to challenge champions. A graph representation of the medical images enabled good handling of complexity and irregularity. Our work provides an automatic secondary check pipeline to ensure the correctness of MGMT methylation status prediction. © 2024 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)",10.1117/1.JMI.11.1.014503,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85186366156&doi=10.1117%2f1.JMI.11.1.014503&partnerID=40&md5=3fff353b0a795052aa4c6f000e99b160,SCOPUS,No,Relacionado con cancer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Javier,Risk-taking dynamics in tournaments: Evidence from professional golf,"We use a unique dataset comprised of observations from ten years of professional golf tournaments to analyze golfers' risk-taking strategies. We focus on analyzing the decisions golfers made when hitting their second shots on par five holes, a shot that often forces golfers to play daringly or conservatively, with little in between. Successful gambles often lead to profitable outcomes when executed well but leave golfers open to tail-end risks for poorly struck shots. Our analysis yields three interesting findings, all of which are closely related to previous studies of strategic risk. First, the strategies golfers adopt hew closely to the way economic agents in other settings cope with uncertainty. Second, golfers' decisions are dynamic throughout tournaments, especially when playing relatively well early in a tournament and near the halfway mark of a tournament when the worst-performing half of the field is cut. We use regression discontinuity tools to show meaningful differences between the decisions made by golfers on either side of the cut score. Last, we argue golfers' willingness to take risks was affected by Superstar Tiger Woods, a finding that suggests a strategic component of the Superstar Effect needs to be considered alongside the effort component, as discussed in Brown (2011).

Javier,Badminton as a dynamic system–A new method for analyzing badminton matches based on perturbations,"This study presents a method for analysing badminton matches based on the concept of perturbations. We transfer this principle to a badminton rally and describe the decisive shot, which turns a balanced situation into an advantage for one team or one player. Our paper proposes an observational system, which models the decisive shots by using four consecutive actions: impulse (the perturbation), follow-up, survival, and convert. To test the objectivity of the operationalization, independent raters analysed six matches in the singles disciplines of the 2022 World Championships. To evaluate rater agreement, Jaccard coefficient and Cohen’s kappa were used. Results show an agreement in identifying impulses of J(R1, R2) =.80, while the agreement in classifying the impulse type (positive/negative) reached κ =.70. A comparison of this perturbation-based analysis and last shot analyses shows significantly different results. Direct errors usually occur in the midcourt (56.4%), whereas most negative perturbations originate from the backcourt (40.0%). In contrast to direct winners, mostly originating from a smash (45.5%), most positive perturbations are created by net shots (30.1%). We argue that our method can be complementary to common last shot analyses and provides a possibility to describe players’ strengths and weaknesses in more detail. © 2024 The Author(s).

Javier,Deepfakes: Future of Sports and Questioning Video Evidence,"Although there are studies on tricking opponents or deceptive action in sports, similar actions involving video manipulation is not widely studied. Yet, the phenomenon of video manipulation, some using artificial intelligence, has been on the rise as predicted by Langdon Winner’s technological determinism hypothesis. The concern for video manipulation in wider social activities has risen, leading to a Willingham article for CNN in 2020 titled “Is That Video Real?"" A rash of manipulated videos exists in the political arena and elsewhere and has been a concern in the United States. For instance, images and voices of political figures are electronically manipulated or doctored. In sports, video footage of football matches may be manipulated to sway public opinion. With video tampering rising, combined with the breakdown of gatekeeping in mass-mediated production, the possibility of manipulating public opinion has been on the rise. The concern is such that the Defense Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is developing an algorithm for analyzing videos to expose inconsistencies, not visible through human eyes. In this chapter, we examine how video manipulations may affect sporting contests that increasingly rely on video examination of actions for decision-making. This is important given the fact that sporting activities are anchored on fair play and objectivity. Our analysis introduces the phenomenon of video manipulation and examines its presence in social activities and particularly its probable use in sports, especially football. We then conclude our analysis by projecting how authorities might confront the phenomenon in the future to maintain public trust in sporting contests. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.",10.1007/978-3-031-27696-5_8,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85172114465&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-031-27696-5_8&partnerID=40&md5=2b01654ebe001f7edfd5eef08446b497,SCOPUS,No,uso de deepfakes en el deporte,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Javier,Players' participation in team possessions of the 2014 FIFA® world cup semi-finalists,"Purpose. In soccer, teammates are required to behave in a synchronized fashion to generate an effective unity. The study aim was to compare the number of players participating in team possessions of the 4 semi-finalists of the 2014 FIFA® World Cup. Methods. The sample of this observational study comprised 2372 team possessions of the 2014 FIFA® World Cup semifinalists (Germany, Argentina, the Netherlands, and Brazil). Descriptive analysis was performed, and the Kolmogorov- Smirnov normality test was applied. The Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests served to verify the overall and specific effects of the number of players participating in team possessions. Effect sizes were reported as Pearson's r. The significance level was set at p < 0.05. The SPSS software version 22 was used for statistical procedures. Results. The tournament winners (Germany) displayed significantly higher means of the number of players per possession than the Netherlands and Brazil (U = 144.797; p < 0.001; small effect; and U = 158.501; p < 0.001; small effect, respectively), as did the runners-up, Argentina (U = 140.253; p = 0.012; negligible effect; and U = 154.226; p < 0.001; small effect, respectively). The Netherlands had a significantly higher mean number of players participating in team possessions than Brazil (U = 160.467; p = 0.014; negligible effect). Conclusions. The teams who reached the tournament final circulated the ball by using more players than those eliminated in the semi-finals. Future studies should verify the potential utilization of the number of players as an indicator of competitive success.  © University School of Physical Education in Wroclaw.",10.5114/hm.2021.104186,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85115973277&doi=10.5114%2fhm.2021.104186&partnerID=40&md5=25b41e05cb7db63ff44f5b03b60d8b80,SCOPUS,No,Participación de jugadores en posesiones de los 4 semifinalistas mundial 2014,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"HOME ADVANTAGE IN THE CZECH FOOTBALL LEAGUE BEFORE, DURING AND AFTER THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC; [Przewaga gospodarzy w czeskiej lidze piłkarskiej przed, w trakcie i po pandemii COVID-19]","The COVID-19 pandemic disease had a huge impact on professional football and led to the introduction of significant spectator restrictions. The most significant restriction was the banning of spectators from entering the stadium. This paper evaluates home advantage and the extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on home advantage in men’s professional football in the Czech top football league. The research findings can be useful in various decision-making areas, such as team game strategies or betting strategies. The research compares the results of matches played with spectators with the results of matches played without spectators or with spectator restrictions. The method chosen to quantify home advantage considers points and goals scored and uses a two-sample Mann-Whitney test. The COVID-19 pandemic had no statistically significant effect on home advantage. Home advantage persisted even without spectators, although to a lesser extent. The research concluded that home advantage may be reduced but not lost in the absence of spectators. However, more detailed analyses are needed in future studies to identify the main determinants of this phenomenon across football leagues and countries. © 2024, Stanislaw Podobinski Publishing House of the Jan Dlugosz University.

Javier,The Effect of Gambling Motivation of Sport Spectators on Propensity for Violence in Sport,"The study aims to analyse the relationships between sport spectators' gambling motivation and propensity for violence. Descriptive and relational screening model were used in this study. Study group is composed of 539 volunteers determined via purposeful and convenient sampling. Personal Information Form was prepared by the researchers of the study; andGambling Motivations ScaleandSport Spectators Aggression and Violence Scalewere used to gather the data. For inferential statistics, Pearson Correlation Analysis was conducted to reveal the relationships between some variables and sub-scales of measurement tools. Furthermore, multi variable relations between sub-scales of Gambling Motivation Scale and sub-scales of The Sport Spectator Aggression and Violence Scale were analysed through Canonical Correlation Analysis. The results of correlation analysis show that there is a weak significant positive correlation between both the frequency of sport gambling and gambling motivation, and between the frequency of sport gambling and sport spectators' aggression in all sub scales. In addition, weak significant and positive correlation between both the level of fandom and gambling motivation, and the level of fandom and aggression of spectators was found in all sub-scales. As for the correlation between consuming alcohol before matches and gambling motivation and sport spectators aggression, not consuming alcohol before matches was found significantly high correlated compared to consuming alcohol before matches. In conclusion, it can be said there is a relation between gambling motivation and aggression and propensity for violence. Moreover, it can be thought the fact that the perceived fandom level of gambler sport spectators is high causes the increase in aggression and propensity for violence.",10.1007/s10899-020-09956-z,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10899-020-09956-z,WOS,No,Relacion entre apostar y la predisposicion a violencia en en deportes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Machine learning for sports betting: Should model selection be based on accuracy or calibration?,"Sports betting's recent federal legalisation in the USA coincides with the golden age of machine learning. If bettors can leverage data to reliably predict the probability of an outcome, they can recognise when the bookmaker's odds are in their favour. As sports betting is a multi-billion dollar industry in the USA alone, identifying such opportunities could be extremely lucrative. Many researchers have applied machine learning to the sports outcome prediction problem, generally using accuracy to evaluate the performance of predictive models. We hypothesise that for the sports betting problem, model calibration is more important than accuracy. To test this hypothesis, we train models on NBA data over several seasons and run betting experiments on a single season, using published odds. We show that using calibration, rather than accuracy, as the basis for model selection leads to greater returns, on average (return on investment of +34.69% versus-35.17%) and in the best case (+36.93% versus +5.56%). These findings suggest that for sports betting (or any probabilistic decision-making problem), calibration is a more important metric than accuracy. Sports bettors who wish to increase profits should therefore select their predictive model based on calibration, rather than accuracy.",10.1016/j.mlwa.2024.100539,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mlwa.2024.100539,WOS,Si,Importancia de calibracion frente accuracy para modelos de apuestas deportivas,"Accuracy, Calibration, ROI","Random Forest, Linear Regresion, Support Vector Machine, perceptron multicapa",Baloncesto,NBA,masculino,,"Feature enegeneering y selection

Javier,Mixed Martial Arts Bout Prediction Using Artificial Intelligence,"In modern times, boxing is not the only sport that is based on martial arts. The competitor to boxing has recently risen in the form of mixed martial arts (MMA), which is becoming quite a famous sport, most notably recognized due to the Ultimate Fighting Championship promotion (UFC). As with most other competitive sports, it is never obvious who will emerge as the winner of a specific MMA bout, as the sport is very unpredictable by nature. This paper focuses on using machine learning (ML) algorithms and classifiers to predict the winners of MMA bouts in the Ultimate Fighting Championship promotion. The data used to train and test the algorithms and classifiers is sampled from the rich UFC database which includes details from all bouts that have taken place in the UFC throughout the history of the promotion. The predictions are obtained without using any data that can directly indicate the winner of a bout. The results are presented through accuracy percentages for two different types of sample sets. Successful bout prediction percentages range from 80% to just over 92% across all subsets. This model can be further expanded and modified to predict the winner for future matchups in the promotion. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",10.1007/978-3-031-17697-5_36,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85141665544&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-031-17697-5_36&partnerID=40&md5=0025f50cb37fd072ff5d527d6696a5e2,SCOPUS,Podría Ser,Prediccion de resultaods de combates MMA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,A statistical theory of optimal decision-making in sports betting,"The recent legalization of sports wagering in many regions of North America has renewed attention on the practice of sports betting. Although considerable effort has been previously devoted to the analysis of sportsbook odds setting and public betting trends, the principles governing optimal wagering have received less focus. Here the key decisions facing the sports bettor are cast in terms of the probability distribution of the outcome variable and the sportsbook's proposition. Knowledge of the median outcome is shown to be a sufficient condition for optimal prediction in a given match, but additional quantiles are necessary to optimally select the subset of matches to wager on (i.e., those in which one of the outcomes yields a positive expected profit). Upper and lower bounds on wagering accuracy are derived, and the conditions required for statistical estimators to attain the upper bound are provided. To relate the theory to a real-world betting market, an empirical analysis of over 5000 matches from the National Football League is conducted. It is found that the point spreads and totals proposed by sportsbooks capture 86% and 79% of the variability in the median outcome, respectively. The data suggests that, in most cases, a sportsbook bias of only a single point from the true median is sufficient to permit a positive expected profit. Collectively, these findings provide a statistical framework that may be utilized by the betting public to guide decision-making. © 2023 Jacek P. Dmochowski.

Javier,Men and football in Africa,"Football in Africa remains a male-dominated space. This chapter traces male dominance in the game showing how the idea of maleness is embraced across the game. The widespread popularity of the game makes it an important prism to understand men and the idea of maleness in Africa. Football has provided an important space for the construction, valorisation and celebration of specific types of masculinities across the continent. Sexual symbols and phallocentric images permeate football culture making the sport a male-dominated space. In this chapter we analyse the place of men in African football, noting how men and hegemonic masculinities dominate various parts of the sport, including ownership of teams, playing, coaching, refereeing and fan cultures. Using various scholarly works on football from across Africa, we highlight how masculinities are interwoven with the everyday notion of football to the extent that for a long time the sport was sorely played by men. The chapter also interrogates how men dominate football consumption spaces including bars, sports betting halls and stadiums. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

Javier,Spot allocation design in the national high school rugby tournament based on quantitative strength evaluation method; [定量的実力評価指標に基づく全国高等学校ラグビーフットボール大会出場校数割当の設計],"This paper discusses spot allocation in the national high school rugby tournament based on a quantitative strength evaluation method. In the national high school rugby tournament in Japan, each prefecture receives one spot except Hokkaido, which has two spots; Tokyo, which also has two; and Osaka, which has three. In this paper, Kanagawa and Fukuoka prefectures, whose representative teams achieved outstanding results in recent nationwide tournaments, are considered good candidates for extra spots in the tournament. This paper proposes an Elo-based quantitative skill evaluation method using about 1,800 match results. The evaluation results show high accuracy (84%) in match result prediction. In addition, the gaps between the winners and the finalists in Kanagawa and Fukuoka prefectures can be estimated. According to the results, the second team in Kanagawa ranked in the top 10 in the nationwide tournament; therefore, Kanagawa should receive an extra spot in it. © 2019 The Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan.",10.1541/ieejeiss.139.1415,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85076039291&doi=10.1541%2fieejeiss.139.1415&partnerID=40&md5=75776d8730a0a8b02841e9c49991e9e2,SCOPUS,No,Donde poner nuevos equipos de rugby instituto en japón,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Javier,Validity of Performance Assessment Methods in Elite Paracanoeists,"The problem of valid and reliable research methods in paralympic sports seems of great significance, thus the aim of this study was to evaluate the validity of the Wingate test (WAnT) in assessment of anaerobic performance in elite paracanoeists competing in 200 m races. Seven paralympic athletes (32.6 ± 7.76 years), medal winners and finalists of the Paralympic Games, World and European Championships, as well as World Cups were examined. The evaluations were conducted during a competition which was held at the paralympic distance of 200 m, and included the WAnT for upper limbs and the anaerobic threshold test (ATT). Correlations of selected indices of mechanical work and power in the WAnT, as well as anaerobic threshold (AT) power, with the time recorded during the competition were used to determine indices which affected paracanoeing performance. The results indicated strong negative correlations with time achieved in the competition between peak power and total work in the WAnT, and AT power (R = -0.796 p = 0.032; R = -0.882 p = 0.009; R = -0.900 p < 0.001, respectively). The research confirmed the validity of the WAnT for the upper limbs to assess the performance level of paracanoeists. It may be concluded that the WAnT and ATT may be used for monitoring performance during the paralympic 200 m race. © 2021 Michal Starczewski, Piotr Zmijewski, Andrzej Klusiewicz, published by Sciendo",10.2478/hukin-2021-0074,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85124880549&doi=10.2478%2fhukin-2021-0074&partnerID=40&md5=f4671951957d80331b0b0a1f1a364d95,SCOPUS,No,Rendimiento de atletas paralímpicos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Modeling and Predicting the Outcomes of NBA Basketball Games,"Point spreads betting based on the approximation of score difference is prevalent within the NBA community. In this work, the primary objective is to construct a multidimensional linear model that incorporates both game and player information to forecast the score difference of NBA basketball games. We first considered the SHT Model that contains merely game information, including team intrinsic Strength, Home court advantage, and Tiredness due to successive games. The model is adequately convincing since the estimates are legitimate in terms of their signs and magnitudes. We further examined the influence of the absence of players on forecasting the score difference and applied the respective salary as a weighting factor to add variability into the model. The prediction results indicate that the SHT Model has the highest accuracy in predicting score difference, which will be adopted as our final model. Tests on different seasons demonstrate the final model's stability and practice ability.  © 2021 ACM.",10.1145/3501774.3501788,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85127524749&doi=10.1145%2f3501774.3501788&partnerID=40&md5=3725f872fc087b8ff82812df230cac8a,SCOPUS,Si,Modelos de prediccion de partidos NBA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Javier,Women who watch and support English football in Zimbabwe: a transnational analysis of female fandoms,"In this paper, we explore the lived experiences of women who watch and support English football teams in Zimbabwe. We utilized a qualitative research approach that included in-depth interviews and football ethnographies in spaces where English football is consumed such as bars, betting halls, upmarket clubs, restaurants, hotels, and sports clubs. The paper provides a nuanced analysis of how women become part of and participate in transnational forms of cultural consumption, in this case, English football. Other major themes outlined in the paper include how and where women consume English football, performance and practices of female fans. Firstly, from our observation and fieldwork experiences in Zimbabwe men make up most transnational fans. Secondly, the spaces where football is consumed especially public spaces are male dominated. The paper concludes that transnational fan identities are gendered in multiple ways. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",10.1080/14660970.2022.2037207,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85124341143&doi=10.1080%2f14660970.2022.2037207&partnerID=40&md5=6b087a5f1544c8a0a6083173e17813fe,SCOPUS,No,Mujeres que apoyan a equipos de futbol ingles en Zimbabwe,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Javier,Statistical Models for Predicting Results in Professional League of Legends,"The esports industry has seen enormous growth in popularity. With increased viewership and revenue, further investment has been made to improve professional players’ competitive strength. The modern esports team is a hierarchical business fuelled by investors and sponsorship. This paper is focused on the professional competitions in League of Legends esports. In existing real-world sports such as football or baseball, there is great attention paid to statistic driven analysis of the competition, and these stats are used to quantify player and team performance. These statistics hold significant value for competitive improvement, the gambling industry, and market influence within the esports industry. This paper presents an analysis of data and metrics gathered from professional games during 2020 in several League of Legends international competitions. The objective was to build a predictive model through the combination of existing data analysis and machine learning that can rate team and player performance. The best performing model was able to correctly predict 67% of 306 games. Results indicate that while it is possible to predict the outcome of a competitive League of Legends game, to do so with a higher degree of accuracy would require substantially more data and contextual information. © 2022, ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering.",10.1007/978-3-030-95531-1_10,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85125223765&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-030-95531-1_10&partnerID=40&md5=b1232d3625d4fd77dff70ad2c72caffb,SCOPUS,Podría Ser,Modelos estadísticos para predecir partidos de LOL,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Javier,Stroke analysis in padel according to match outcome and game side on court,"The aim of this study was to analyze the distribution of padel strokes, their effectiveness, direction, and court zone, comparing between the winning and losing pairs in the match and the playing side of the players. The sample included 8441 strokes corresponding to 1055 points out of a total of nine padel matches in the First National Category. The variables analyzed were type of stroke, court area, effectiveness and directions of the strokes, match outcome, and game side. Matches were analyzed through systematic observation. The results showed that the winning pair made a significantly higher percentage of winners, and cross-court smashes and volleys from the offensive zone. In addition, players on the left side executed a higher percentage of cross-court and winning shots than the players on the right side. Such knowledge may constitute a useful guide in the design of appropriate game strategies and specific training sessions based on the shots that will help players to win the match according to the role of the player and depending on their game side. © 2020 by the authors.

Javier,"Brain Endurance Training Improves Physical, Cognitive, and Multitasking Performance in Professional Football Players","Purpose: Brain endurance training (BET)—the combination of physical training with mentally fatiguing tasks—could help athletes adapt and increase their performance during sporting competitions. Here we tested whether BET completed after standard physical training improved physical and mental performance more than physical training alone during a preseason football training camp. Methods: The study employed a pretest/training/posttest design, with 22 professional football players randomly assigned to BET or a control group. Both groups completed 40 physical training sessions over 4 weeks. At the end of a day of physical training, the BET group completed cognitive training, whereas the control group listened to neutral sounds. Players completed the 30–15 Intermittent Fitness Test, repeated sprint ability random test, soccer-specific reactive agility test, and Stroop and psychomotor vigilance tests pretraining and posttraining. Mixed analysis of variance was used to analyze the data. Results: In the posttest (but not pretest) assessments, the BET group consistently outperformed the control group. Specifically, the BET group was faster (P = .02–.04) than the control group during the 30–15 Intermittent Fitness Test, the directional phase of the repeated sprint ability random test, and the soccer-specific reactive agility test. The BET group also made fewer errors (P = .02) during the soccer-specific reactive agility test than the control group. Finally, the BET group responded faster (P = .02) on the Stroop test and made fewer (P = .03) lapses on the psychomotor vigilance test than the control group. Conclusion: The inclusion of BET during the preseason seems more effective than standard physical training alone in improving the physical, cognitive, and multitasking performance of professional football players. © 2022 Human Kinetics, Inc.",10.1123/ijspp.2022-0144,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85143201296&doi=10.1123%2fijspp.2022-0144&partnerID=40&md5=ab667ad7a0306edf51fb9858103e41ad,SCOPUS,No,evaluar si entrenamiento de resistencia cerebral (BET) tiene impacto positivo en rendimiento de atletas,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Javier,Gambling-like Features in fan Tokens,"Fan tokens are a form of cryptocurrency that allow owners to participate in various fan-related experiences such as voting on the music to be played during half-time breaks in sporting events. Since 2020, many elite sport teams have issued fan tokens, allegedly as a way to engage with fans and hear their voice. However, fan tokens also raise some concerns. They are largely gamified digital items that intend to keep fans within the providers’ app. Also, they can be traded in exchange platforms, which arguably transform them into collectibles, whose value can vary over time. Here, we explore fan tokens through a case study from a football (soccer) club (i.e., an F.C. Barcelona fan token). Drawing on literature from situational and structural characteristics of gambling, we analyse the gambling-like features that fan tokens include in their product design. Such features are discussed from a public health perspective, comparing what they mean in gambling contexts and how potentially harmful they could be for fan token holders. © 2023, The Author(s).",10.1007/s10899-023-10215-0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85159335468&doi=10.1007%2fs10899-023-10215-0&partnerID=40&md5=0e88f71f86feb941cd392c8df7faf4d2,SCOPUS,No,Tokens de equipos ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Javier,The association between the ‘whistle-to-whistle’ ban and the presence of gambling advertising on UK television,"Background: A previous study explored how restrictions on gambling advertising, known as the ‘whistle-to-whistle’ (W2W) ban, were associated with changes in television advertising around live football broadcasts in the United Kingdom. This study explores changes around other live sports broadcasts, and other programming, in the years before and after the W2W ban. Methods: TV scheduling (Concise Media) and gambling advertising data (Nielsen Media) between 1 September and 1 December in the pre (2018) and post-W2W ban (2019) periods were used. Linear regression models assessed changes in the frequency of advertising during sports (football, horse racing, other), and other television programming (documentaries, drama, entertainment, film, leisure, music, news, other). Results: Results corroborate previous findings; the W2W ban was associated with a decrease in gambling advertising around live football (2.9 advertisements per-program; p <.001) and other live sports (0.8 advertisements per-program; p <.001), except horse racing where advertising increased (2.5 advertisements per-program; p <.001). There were small changes in advertising around other types of programming during the same years. Conclusions: Voluntary partial gambling advertising restrictions were associated with a reduction in television advertising across all live sports, except horse racing where advertising increased. There were small changes across the rest of the UK TV network. Understanding the magnitude of reductions on gambling behavior is complex since advertisements were not eliminated post-W2W ban period. Increased advertising around live horse racing programs might also mitigate the effects. These results have implications for global gambling policy, highlighting important considerations for the overall efficacy of partial, and voluntary, advertising restrictions. © 2024 The Author(s).

Javier,RoboCup2022 KidSize League Winner CIT Brains: Open Platform Hardware SUSTAINA-OP and Software,"We describe the technologies of our autonomous soccer humanoid robot system that won the RoboCup2022 Humanoid KidSize League. For RoboCup2022, we developed both hardware and software. We developed a new hardware SUSTAINA-OP. We aimed to make it easier to build, harder to break, and easier to maintain than our previous robot. SUSTAINA-OP is an open hardware platform. As the control circuit, we selected a computer with higher processing power for deep learning. We also developed its software. In terms of image processing, the new system uses deep learning for all object detection. In addition, for the development of action decision-making, we built a system to visualize the robot’s states and solved many problems. Furthermore, kicking forward at an angle action is added as a new tactical action. In RoboCup2022, even when the robots were facing each other with the ball between them, by this action the robot succeeded in getting the ball out in the direction of the opponent’s goal. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",10.1007/978-3-031-28469-4_18,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85152575458&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-031-28469-4_18&partnerID=40&md5=ee5e00bd0f17099ac0b57d28a0c75832,SCOPUS,No,HW y SW de robocop,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Javier,Separating winning and losing teams in sitting volleyball: the role of skills and differences across gender,"Sitting volleyball (SV) is a dynamic with short actions sport in the paralympic programme. The purpose of the study was to identify the volleyball skills that best discriminate between winning and losing an SV set, for both the genders. The data were collected from all sets played (N = 224) on the 2019 European men and women SV Championship. Cluster analysis established three types of sets according to the final score difference: 2–4 points (balanced), 5–11 points (semi-balanced) and over 11 points (unbalanced). Three-way MANOVAs were conducted to analyse gender, type of set and type of result differences for selected performance indicators. The analyses revealed significant multivariate differences across gender (p <.001), types of set (p =.014) and result (p <.001) and significant interaction effect of result with gender (p =.025) and type of set (p <.001). A follow-up discriminant analysis showed that setting and attacking were the most important skills for all sets. The results showed that in SV the attack is the most important factor, which determines winners and losers, even in balanced sets. In SV, the importance of skills across gender was similar to volleyball, while there were differences in the structure of the game compared to the sequential order of skills in volleyball. © 2023 Cardiff Metropolitan University.",10.1080/24748668.2023.2238167,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85165693268&doi=10.1080%2f24748668.2023.2238167&partnerID=40&md5=a29382d6af78e8e3d08c612bcd2de44f,SCOPUS,No,Habilidades que permiten diferenciar entre gandor y perdedor en voley paralimpico,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Javier,Efficient load value prediction using multiple predictors and filters,"Value prediction [1], [2] has the potential to break through the performance limitations imposed by true data dependencies. Aggressive value predictors can deliver significant performance improvements, but usually require large hardware budgets. While predicting values of all instruction types is possible, prior work has shown that predicting just load values is most effective with a modest hardware budget (e.g., 8KB of prediction state [3], [4]). However, with hardware budget constraints and high prediction accuracy requirements (99%), prior work has struggled to increase the fraction of predicted loads (coverage) beyond the low 30s. In this paper, we analyzed four state-of-the-art load value predictors, and found that they complement each other. Based on that finding, we evaluated a new composite predictor that combines all four component predictors. Our results show that the composite predictor, combined with several optimizations we proposed, improve the benefit of load value prediction by 54%-74% depending on the total predictor budget. Moreover, our composite predictor delivers more than twice the coverage of first championship value prediction winner predictor (EVES [4]), and substantially increases the delivered speedup by more than 50%. © 2019 IEEE.",10.1109/HPCA.2019.00057,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85064232355&doi=10.1109%2fHPCA.2019.00057&partnerID=40&md5=da6b84ab75a1fe468dd78e6d72d86930,SCOPUS,No,Uso de predictores de carga compuestos para obtener mejores resultados,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Javier,Unravelling the Zheyun Ye football scandal: A crime script analysis of the modus operandi to commit money laundering and tax fraud,"This study provides an overview of the modus operandi used in one of the biggest fraud cases in Belgian football, known as the Zheyun Ye case. The case consists of several phenomena related to betting-related match-fixing. Given the fact that money laundering and tax fraud are often essential factors in betting-related match-fixing schemes and the fragmented research on these types of financial misconducts in sports, we analyzed the modus operandi used by the fraudsters in this case to commit money laundering and tax fraud through the football sector. To accomplish this, we conducted a crime scripting analysis, utilizing the court files of the case, compromising 41 547 pages. Furthermore, we conducted qualitative interviews (n = 7) with law enforcement key informants and professionals within the football milieu to triangulate the data of the court files. By doing so, we lay down the basis for two different crime scripts of financial misconduct through football: one focusing on money laundering and another on tax fraud. Based on our findings, we conclude that during the time of the Zheyun Ye case, certain conditions distinctive to the football landscape were major contributors to these financial malpractices. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.",10.1007/s12117-024-09545-1,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85201522347&doi=10.1007%2fs12117-024-09545-1&partnerID=40&md5=b97865c4682228aa504021faa9bf1713,SCOPUS,No,Modus operandi en escandalo caso de fraude en belgica,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Javier,Rugby-ball like Ag modified zirconium porphyrin metal–organic frameworks nanohybrid for antimicrobial activity: Synergistic effect for significantly enhancing photoactivation capacity,"Despite of the current advancement in antibacterial material, the bacterial issues are still great challenges in health problems worldwide. Herein, Ag nanoparticles doped to zirconium porphyrin metal–organic frameworks (ZPM@Ag) were synthesized for antibacterial activity. The effect of different dosage of Ag nanoparticles on the antibacterial activity was also investigated. The morphology, porous microstructure, and composition of the prepared nanohybrids were characterized by SEM, TEM, XRD, FT-IR, XPS and BET analysis. The results revealed that the optimized antimicrobial efficiency was ZPM@Ag(2). The reactive oxygen species (ROS) production of ZPM@Ag(2) under visible light was obviously abundant than that in the dark, and moreover, the nanohybrid exhibited high antimicrobial efficacy. Furthermore, the antimicrobial mechanism of the prepared sample was also carefully investigated. The enhanced photoactivation antimicrobial activity could be ascribed to the synergistic effect between zirconium porphyrin MOFs (ZPM) and Ag nanoparticles, which possesses high specific surface area and abundant active sites due to the uniform rugby-ball like shape. ZPM@Ag(2) nanohybrid was demonstrated excellent stability even after five cycles. The antimicrobial Ag nanoparticles immobilized in photocatalytic antibacterial porous MOFs are expected to provide a guideline to broaden the applications of MOFs and design novel metal-based antibacterial nanomaterials. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.colsurfa.2020.125888,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85096119250&doi=10.1016%2fj.colsurfa.2020.125888&partnerID=40&md5=9e505879b09979b718709c8e3702b981,SCOPUS,No,Cosas biológicas,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Javier,Analysis of the Relative Age Effect in Elite Wrestlers; [Analiza efektu względnego wieku wśród elitarnych zapaśników],"Background. The relative age effect has been used to refer to the age differences between individuals who have been grouped together in a sports competition. In this sense, the relative age effect is considered a determining factor of sporting success. Problem and Aim. Determine the influence of relative age on the achievement of success by athletes in top-level competitions in modern wrestling. Methods and materials. In the research paper, the data of the athletes (n = 682) who took from 1 to 8 places at the 2017, 2018 and 2019 World Championships and the 2016 Olympic Games in Greco-Roman and freestyle wrestling are considered. The athletes were sub-categorized by the athletes’ dates of birth; medalists; participation and achieved success in the cadets and juniors competitions. Results. There are more athletes who were born in the first half of the year than in the second: 54.7% versus 45.3%, respectively. The distribution of medal winners by date of birth is as follows: it turned out that 53.3% of medalists were born in the first half of the year while 46.7% − in the second half of the year (p>0.05). Conclusion. The data obtained show that the relative age effect does not affect the achievement of success in wrestling and is leveled at the adult stage. However, the analysis has shown that the greatest influence of the relative age effect on athletes was revealed at the cadet level. © Idōkan Poland Association",10.14589/ido.22.3.5,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85133443848&doi=10.14589%2fido.22.3.5&partnerID=40&md5=0465c90efeb3ca8673bff60de4cb224b,SCOPUS,No,Importancia edad relativa en combates de lcuha,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The objective of this research is to make a joint analysis of the probabilities of offline and online sports gambling participation, focusing on their association with sport-related variables. To this aim, we estimate a bivariate probit model of online and offline sports betting using the 2022 Spanish Survey of Sporting Habits, a cross-sectional database representative of the Spanish population (sample size: 10,267 observations). In general, interest in sports and sports practice are correlated with sports betting. Moreover, people who play sports and, in particular, those who play football, have a higher probability of betting offline. In the case of online betting, all sport-related variables are statistically significant but sports participation. Another noteworthy result is the positive correlation in the random terms of the probabilities of offline and online sports betting. © The Author(s) 2025.",10.1177/15270025241308846,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85214243021&doi=10.1177%2f15270025241308846&partnerID=40&md5=440a8883ae5cbcf36ed53fd6fee920a3,SCOPUS,No,correlacion entre apostar e interes en deporte o su participacion,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Javier,Exposure to Gambling and Alcohol Marketing in Soccer Matchday Programmes,"The UK’s Premier League and Championship are two of the most well attended soccer leagues worldwide; however, little is known regarding exposure to gambling marketing through the matchday experience. The current study sought to quantify exposure to gambling and alcohol marketing, and responsible gambling messages within matchday programmes. Programmes for each team in the English Premier League and Championship were analysed across consecutive matchday weekends, made available to 1,269,404 match-going fans. Direct adverts for, and incidental exposure to, gambling, alcohol, and responsible gambling marketing or messages were coded. Direct adverts were counted, as were absolute counts and percentage of pages with incidental exposure. Programmes averaged 2.3 direct gambling adverts and 37.8 instances of incidental gambling marketing exposure. Incidental gambling marketing was found on 22.2% of pages. There was more gambling marketing than either alcohol marketing or responsible gambling messages. This was observed across: number of direct adverts (p <.001), incidents of exposure (p <.001) and the percentage of pages with exposure (p <.001). Teams with gambling shirt sponsors had more incidental marketing exposure, in both absolute count (p <.001) and percentage of pages (p <.001) but did not have more direct gambling adverts (p =.63). Incidental exposure to gambling marketing was present in 59.0% of children’s specific sections of programmes. There was greater exposure to gambling marketing in soccer matchday programmes. Gambling marketing was frequently evident in child specific sections of matchday programmes. Attending soccer matches and reading the matchday programme increases exposure to gambling. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",10.1007/s10899-019-09912-6,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85075251104&doi=10.1007%2fs10899-019-09912-6&partnerID=40&md5=d9833c723ee34013ec5a73786a07e7db,SCOPUS,No,Anuncios de Alcohol y apuestas en programas de futbol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Javier,Not feeling the buzz: Correction study of mispricing and inefficiency in online sportsbooks,"We present a replication and correction of a recent article (Ramirez et al., 2023). RRS measure profile page views on Wikipedia to generate a “buzz factor” metric for tennis players and show that it can be used to form a profitable gambling strategy by predicting bookmaker mispricing. Here, we use the same dataset as RRS to reproduce their results exactly, which confirms the robustness of RRS’ mispricing claim. However, we discover that RRS’ published out-of-sample betting results are significantly affected by a single bet (the “Hercog” bet), which returns substantial outlier profits based on erroneously long odds. When this data quality issue is resolved, the majority of reported profits disappear and only one strategy, which bets on “competitive” matches, remains significantly profitable in the original out-of-sample period. While one profitable strategy offers weaker support than the original study, it still provides an indication that market inefficiencies may exist, as originally claimed by RRS. As an extension, we continue testing after 2020. The strategy generates no further profits and model coefficients estimated over this period are no longer reliable predictors of bookmaker mispricing. © 2024 The Author(s)",10.1016/j.ijforecast.2024.06.012,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85199682024&doi=10.1016%2fj.ijforecast.2024.06.012&partnerID=40&md5=c8e057581770fb6c95d56c1af298d926,SCOPUS,No,Correccion estudio previo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Javier,Do financial markets price UEFA Champions League competition events?,"Purpose: This paper investigates the stock market reaction to three different events related to the UEFA Champions League – the announcements of draws, odds and match results. The aim of the paper is to test whether these events are informative for stock market operators, i.e. whether they produce abnormal returns. Design/methodology/approach: Applying the event study methodology, the authors investigate the stock market reaction before (at two events: the draw date and on the release of betting odds) and after the matches of 11 listed soccer teams in the period 2003–2019. The authors also conduct OLS regression analyses in order to disentangle the impact of firm specific variables and match characteristics on cumulative abnormal returns. Findings: This paper finds that match outcomes affect the stock market performance of listed teams, while the announcements of draws and odds do not. More specifically, the market does not consider match outcomes involving wins and ties as informative events, while it penalizes losing teams. Moreover, investor reactions to events related to the UCL competition depend more on match characteristics than on company specific variables. Originality/value: The study enriches the ongoing debate about the impact of soccer team results on stock market performance in several ways: using the widest time span ever adopted in this area; focusing on UCL, which is the most important soccer competition played by private clubs; disentangling for the first time the effects of draws, odds release and sporting outcome on stock returns of listed soccer clubs. © 2022, Maria Gaia Soana, Andrea Lippi and Simone Rossi.",10.1108/EMJB-09-2021-0134,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85132380042&doi=10.1108%2fEMJB-09-2021-0134&partnerID=40&md5=b3ac387a85295ccb94820de00db1ace1,SCOPUS,No,Consecuencias en bolsa de resultados deportivos de equipos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Stochastic Modelling of Sport,"Sport provides a rich set of opportunities for the application of stochastic modelling. The discrete nature of some sports (tennis, for example) lends itself to analysis through Markov chains to model how the state of the game changes over time, enabling the estimation of the probabilities of various outcomes. In others there are clear ""risk and reward"" types of decision to be made by the player. There are opportunities to apply game theory, optimisation techniques, dynamic programming, Markov models, and statistical methods to describe and analyse games and sports, ranging from football, tennis and golf to darts and snooker. A good player is generally one who does not merely have good technical skills but is able to make excellent decisions under pressure. The development and application of stochastic models to sports is not merely a source of entertainment for the modeller, they may serve to inform spectators and viewers, and act as decision tools for those involved in in-play betting, in which there has been a huge upsurge of activity in recent years.",10.1109/QEST.2012.40,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6354652,IEEE,Si,Modelos estocasticos en deportes y su posible aplicación en apuestas,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Javier,Relationship between the numerical condition and court position in goal scoring in women’s handball,"Introduction: Handball is characterized by the constant action of attacking and defending, using a common space in the court. In this highly dynamic sport, one of the main factors that affect performance is the numerical condition. Despite its importance, studies concerning female handball lacks investigations regarding the numerical condition and the court position during attacks. Thus, the present study aimed to analyze the relationship between the numerical condition and the court position during the shoots in female handball world championships. Materials and Methods: The analysis was performed using indirect observation of the match recordings. Twenty-five matches of the three last championship teams of the handball world championships were observed, and information regarding the numerical conditions (inferiority, superiority, and equality), and court positions during the attacks were collected. Results: The results showed that most of the shots were goals scored (57.6%), and most of the goals occur in numerical equality (80.6%). Brazil scored 55.2% (264 goals) of the occasions. France scored in 59.6% (238 goals), and Norway scored in 58.7% (193 goals). Also, there are differences between the numerical condition and the distance to the goalpost concerning the goals scored, but no differences were found between the numerical condition and the regions of the court, or goals scored and numerical condition of each team. Conclusions: The findings demonstrate that the numerical condition and the court position during female handball games can influence the shoots, being important variables to coaches and team preparation, which need to be taking to account during the season.Understanding this relationship can also be imperative for the organization of training and game planning. The studied variables show the main idea of the champion team’s game model, being important to understand goals and winners in handball matches. © JPES.",10.7752/jpes.2020.06486,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85098874594&doi=10.7752%2fjpes.2020.06486&partnerID=40&md5=e35131a75bbb637d4d81cf2eed361396,SCOPUS,No,Relación entre marcar gol en balonmano y la ventaja/desventaja/igualdad numérica y posicionamiento en el campo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Javier,Casual bettors and sentiment bias in NBA and NFL betting,"Sentiment bias, defined as investment decisions made for reasons unrelated to fundamentals and related to popularity, represents a common research topic in finance and economics. Empirical research on sentiment bias frequently uses data from sports betting markets. While research generally finds evidence of sentiment bias, in particular, due to team popularity, the prevalence of this bias among fans and bettors in many sports remains unclear and identification of markets with relatively larger numbers of bettors with sentiment bias poses empirical challenges. We analyse outcomes in betting markets for games played in two North American team sports leagues, the National Basketball Association (NBA) and National Football League (NFL) from the 2012–13 to 2016–17 seasons and investigate how game timing, in terms of games played on weekdays and weekends, may affect the presence of bettors with popularity-based sentiment bias. Probit model estimates explaining the probability that a bet on a team wins indicate patterns consistent with the presence of bettors with sentiment bias in the markets for betting on games in the NFL but not in the NBA, and the presence of more such bettors for NFL games played on weekends. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",10.1080/00036846.2020.1776833,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85086942960&doi=10.1080%2f00036846.2020.1776833&partnerID=40&md5=9c49793442996f56bfb7cce82fd6a81b,SCOPUS,No,sesgo de sentimiento/popularidad en apuestas en NFL y NBA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Javier,Longitudinal Analysis of Tactical Strategy in the Men's Division of the Ultimate Fighting Championship,"This study explored longitudinal changes in contemporary mixed martial arts (MMA) combat within the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC). A secondary aim was to investigate how bout duration influences the contribution of performance indicators on outcome. Data were acquired via the official analytics provider to the UFC (FightMetric). Male fights with a winner from between 2000 and 2015 (n = 2,831) were examined, with 13 common performance indicators attained during each round for each participant along with duration (min) and year of fight. Non-metric dimensional scaling (nMDS) was used to examine bout characteristics by year. The Repeated Incremental Pruning to Produce Error Reduction (RIPPER) algorithm was run to determine a set of rules to explain bout outcome. The nMDS displayed that winning bout performance indicator attributes were dissimilar across the years. Eight rules were generated from the RIPPER, with fight duration featuring in three of eight rules.

Javier,"Gambling, cryptocurrency, and financial trading app marketing in English Premier League football: A frequency analysis of in-game logos","Background & aims: The gamblification of UK football has resulted in a proliferation of in-game marketing associated with gambling and gambling-like products such as cryptocurrencies and financial trading apps. The English Premier League (EPL) has in response banned gambling logos on shirt-fronts from 2026 onward. This ban does not affect other types of marketing for gambling (e.g., sleeves and pitch-side hoardings), nor gambling-like products. This study therefore aimed to assess the ban’s implied overall reduction of different types of marketing exposure. Methods: We performed a frequency analysis of logos associated with gambling, cryptocurrency, and financial trading across 10 broadcasts from the 2022/23 EPL season. For each relevant logo, we coded: the marketed product, associated brand, number of individual logos, logo location, logo duration, and whether harm-reduction content was present. Results: There were 20,941 relevant logos across the 10 broadcasts, of which 13,427 (64.1%) were for gambling only, 2,236 (10.7%) were for both gambling and cryptocurrency, 2,014 (9.6%) were for cryptocurrency only, 2,068 (9.9%) were for both cryptocurrency and financial trading, and 1,196 (5.7%) were for financial trading only. There were 1,075 shirt-front gambling-associated logos, representing 6.9% of all gambling-associated logos, and 5.1% of all logos combined. Pitch-side hoardings were the most frequent marketing location (52.3%), and 3.4% of logos contained harm-reduction content. Discussion & Conclusions: Brand logos associated with gambling, cryptocurrency, and financial trading are common within EPL broadcasts. Approximately 1 in 20 gambling and gambling-like logos are subject to the EPL’s voluntary ban on shirt-front gambling sponsorship. © 2023 Akademiai Kiado Rt..

Javier,Gambling advertising during live televised male sporting events in Ireland: A descriptive study,"Objectives: There are no data relating to gambling advertisements shown during live sporting events in Ireland. The aim of the present study was to analyze gambling advertisements shown during live sporting events broadcast in Ireland and to assess these advertisements for responsible gambling (RG) practices. Methods: Sixty-five live televised sporting events comprising Association Football (soccer), Rugby Union, and Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) matches broadcast in Ireland were analyzed. Pre-match (up to 30 minutes before kick-off), half-time, and post-match (up to 30 minutes after the match has ended) advertisement breaks were analyzed for gambling advertisements, including in-game fixed (static advertising) and dynamic (electronic advertisements changing at regular intervals) pitch-side advertising. Gambling advertisements were studied for evidence of RG practices. Results: A total of 3602 television advertisements, 618 dynamic advertisements, and 394 static advertisements were analyzed. Gambling advertisements were shown in 75.4% (n = 49) games and were the seventh most commonly televised advertisement shown overall. Gambling advertising was more common in football (fourth most common advertisement) compared to rugby (12th most common) and GAA (13th most common). Static and dynamic gambling advertising were common during football matches (second and first most common advertisements, respectively). The majority of advertisements contained RG messaging, an age limit, and an RG organization. No advertisements showing responsible gambling tools were observed. Conclusions: Gambling advertisements are commonly shown during live televised sporting broadcasts in Ireland, especially during live football matches and typically before the adult television watershed. Gambling legislation is required to minimize harm to vulnerable groups including children.  © The Author(s), 2020.

Javier,Characteristics of Ireland's Defensive Performance within Their Own 22 m Zone in Rugby Game,"The objective of the game of rugby is to score the maximum number of points possible against the opposing team by running with, passing, kicking, and grounding the ball in accordance with the laws of the game, spirit of the sport, and fair play. [1] Studies have focused on the performance of attacks that focus on the opponent's 22 m with the team attempting to approach the try line to score more points. [2] The top teams in the league reported that they played more frequently and scored more tries in the opponent's 22 m zone, and that they were characterized by a high number of penetration attacks, particularly by runs, from which they scored a high percentage of tries in a short period of time. [3] Further, they have reported that approximately 80% of their goals were scored from the area up to 22 m from the enemy goal line.[4] They analyzed the impact of play within the opponent's 22 m on the victory and defeat percentage in domestic adult rugby. The winners were found to have a higher percentage of set plays and tries owing to opponent error or infringement. In contrast, the losers exhibited a higher percentage of turnovers and infringements that resulted in the loss of attacking rights. However, there studies focused on defense within one's own 22 m are lacking. Therefore, in this study, data from the 2024 GUINNESS MEN'S SIX NATIONS RUGBY provided by Stats Perform, Inc were used to examine the characteristics of Ireland's defensive performance within their own 22 m zone. © 2024 IEEE.",10.1109/ICTKE62841.2024.10787173,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85215083366&doi=10.1109%2fICTKE62841.2024.10787173&partnerID=40&md5=775c68a66e538915864f7b071d9cb8c0,SCOPUS,No,Analisis del ataque de la seleccion de irlanda de rugby,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Is Football Unpredictable? Predicting Matches Using Neural Networks,"The growing sports betting market works on the premise that sports are unpredictable, making it more likely to be wrong than right, as the user has to choose between win, draw, or lose. So could football, the world’s most popular sport, be predictable? This article studies this question using deep neural networks to predict the outcome of football matches using publicly available data. Data from 24,760 matches from 13 leagues over 2 to 10 years were used as input for the neural network and to generate a state-of-the-art validated feature, the pi-rating, and the parameters proposed in this work, such as relative attack, defence, and mid power. The data were pre-processed to improve the network’s interpretation and deal with missing or inconsistent data. With the validated pi-rating, data organisation methods were evaluated to find the most fitting option for this prediction system. The final network has four layers with 100, 80, 5, and 3 neurons, respectively, applying the dropout technique to reduce overfitting errors. The results showed that the most influential features are the proposed relative defending, playmaking, and midfield power, and the home team goal expectancy features, surpassing the pi-rating. Finally, the proposed model obtained an accuracy of 52.8% in 2589 matches, reaching 80.3% in specific situations. These results prove that football can be predictable and that some leagues are more predictable than others. © 2024 by the authors.",10.3390/forecast6040057,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85213427052&doi=10.3390%2fforecast6040057&partnerID=40&md5=f2eb095fae257870fece522e633e2999,SCOPUS,Si,Predicción de resultados de futbol,Accuracy,Red Neuronal,Fútbol,"premiere league, Bundesliga, Ligue 1(francia), Serie A, liga española, Liga Holandesa, Liga Portuguesa, liga turca, Chinese Super League, Liga Argentina, Liga Brasileña, Championship (Inglaterra), Liga Rusa",masculino,Sí,"Generación de variables

Javier,"Mental health problems, health risk behaviors, and prevention: A qualitative interview study on perceptions and attitudes among elite male soccer players","Background: The purpose of this study was to investigate the perception of mental health problems and health risk behaviors among Swedish male elite soccer players and their attitudes toward possible prevention strategies. Method: Twenty elite soccer players, aged 15–30 years, were recruited through purposive sampling and interviewed via a digital video calling platform. A semi-structured interview guide, encompassing questions about mental health problems, health risk behaviors among soccer teams, peer-relations, relations to coaches, and attitudes toward health risk behaviors, along with proposals for effective interventions, was employed. The interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed with qualitative content analysis. Results: The informants reported positive feelings in relation to playing soccer, good health, and few health risk behaviors. Risk factors included a large income, excessive free time, and the need for excitement. Stress and mental health problems were linked to performance pressure, social media, and injuries. Hesitation to talk openly about personal problems due to concerns about negative consequences and the “macho culture” was highlighted as barriers to admit and seek help for personal problems. Some statements indicated openness and the club's efforts to destigmatize personal problems. Positive attitudes toward prevention and suggestions for various measures were prominent. Conclusion: Future research and implementation of interventions should focus on the prevention of health risk behaviors and alleviation of stress and performance pressure, as well as continue the efforts to destigmatize mental health problems and raise awareness among coaches of the importance of their communication and behavior for players' mental health and performance. This could be achieved by developing strategic and systematic policy work, information, and dialogue among players and coaches, in addition to individual digital or face-to-face support, provided by professionals outside the soccer context.

Javier,Champions in the Age of COVID-19,"How should sport deal with prematurely ended seasons? This question is especially relevant to the current COVID-19 interruption that threatens to leave many leagues without champions. We argue that although there can be no winners, in certain situations there should be champions. Relevant to the current situation, we argue that Liverpool FC—currently with a 22+ point lead—should be crowned champions of the English Premier League. However, things are not as simple as simply handing the championship to whoever was in the lead when a season is prematurely ended. Through analogy with a fictional decathlon competition—and with the understanding that sporting seasons are themselves a type of game—we identify three reasons why leading at the moment of cessation is insufficient to be crowned a victor (of an individual event) or a champion (of a season-long competition): doing so fails to respect some valuable skills, fails to allow for luck to play out in an interesting way that affects competitions, and fails to respect competitive strategies. This discussion can then inform determining what, if any, end-of-season accolades are relevant, such as championships, relegation, or promotion. No team can win in a league that has failed to be completed, but there can still be a champion. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",10.1080/17511321.2020.1769172,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85086664871&doi=10.1080%2f17511321.2020.1769172&partnerID=40&md5=2dca09c3213ab7337839f69bc59784b5,SCOPUS,No,Dar como campeón durante el covid sin terminar temporada o no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Javier,Tactical and technical performance analysis of the Male 65 kg category at the Brazilian Shotokan Karate Championship; [ANÁLISE DO DESEMPENHO TÉCNICO-TÁTICO DURANTE O CAMPEONATO BRASILEIRO DE KARATÊ SHOTOKAN],"The aim of the present study was to identify the most used techniques by medalists and defeated athletes during the Brazilian Shotokan Karate Championship of 2017. Eleven fights involving thirteen athletes (28.5±3.7yrs.) who competed in the category “up to 65 Kg 1st KYU” were investigated. Analysis were conducted by six specialists through the observation and register technique using the tactical and technical spreadsheet Scout Karate. The Anova test was used to compare actions and techniques mostly used. The Chi-square test for independent samples was used to verify the existence of significant differences among the techniques used by the winning and defeated athletes (p<0.05). Results show that the most frequent attack during fights was the “Mawashi geri”, 26.3±1.5 times, followed by “Gyaku zuki” with 19.5±2.0 times (p<0.01). The most visualized tactical action during combats was the attack with 47.5±5.5 times (p<0.01). “Mawashi geri” was the mostly used attack (p=0.01) performed by winners (71.4%) when compared with the defeated athletes (28.6%). The results indicate that the “Mawashi geri” attack was the most assertive decision used in the category “up to 65 Kg 1st KYU”. © 2020 Universidade Estadual de Maringa.

Javier,Systematic Analysis of Position-Data-based Key Performance Indicators,"In the past 20 years, performance analysis in soccer has accumulated a wide variety of key performance indicators (KPI's) aimed at reflecting a team's strength and success. Thanks to rapidly advancing technologies and data analytics more sophisticated metrics, requiring high resolution data acquisition and big data methods, are developed. This includes many position-data-based KPI's, which incorporate precise spatial and temporal information about every player and the ball on the field. The present study contributes to this research by performing a large-scale comparison of several metrics mainly based on player positions and passing events. Their association with team's success (derived from goals scored) and team's strength (estimated from pre-game betting odds) is analysed. The systematic analysis revealed relevant results for further KPI research: First, the magnitude of overall correlation coefficients was higher for relative metrics than for absolute metrics. Second, the correlation of metrics with the strength of a team is stronger than the correlation with the game success of a team. Third, correlation analysis with team strength indicated more positive associations, while correlation analysis with success is most likely confounded by the intermediate score line of a game and revealed more negative associations.  © 2023 Justus Schlenger et al., published by Sciendo.",10.2478/ijcss-2023-0006,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85163990178&doi=10.2478%2fijcss-2023-0006&partnerID=40&md5=db78141eaea6f5a5d20d2d53a3532159,SCOPUS,Podría Ser,KPI futbol basadas en el pase y posicion de jugadores y relación con marcar goles o fuerza equipo basadas en apuestas previas partido,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Javier,The creative use of defeat is control in metaphors for sport: A study of NBA news headlines written in Chinese,"Many studies investigated metaphors in news; however, few of them focused specifically on headlines. By investigating metaphors in 133 collected NBA news headlines written in Chinese, this paper analyzes the creativity in them. Conceptual Metaphor Theory, including conceptual metonymy, is adopted to discuss creative linguistic metaphors and their corresponding conceptual mappings based on diverse translated names of NBA teams and on specific verbs associated with them. Blending Theory is exploited to further account for the process of metaphorical creativity with the names of the teams being involved. As a whole, the findings show that the concept of defeat is creatively utilized as it is physically and/or socially constructed with the co-use of translated NBA team names and the associated verbs in Chinese. As for the process of the metaphorical creativity, three ways of achieving novelty is revealed, involving the names of the winner, the loser, or both of them respectively. Furthermore, because the data transcends the boundaries of countries, creativity is afforded and extended by reporting in Chinese a sport event taking place in an English-speaking country. © 2020 JLLS and the Author - Published by JLLS.",10.17263/JLLS.712632,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85086156818&doi=10.17263%2fJLLS.712632&partnerID=40&md5=15a4c3941253036616158ae11b9b4316,SCOPUS,No,Metaforas en los titulares de NBA en chino,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Javier,Home advantage in professional soccer and betting market efficiency: The role of spectator crowds,"Fan support has often been considered to be a main driver of the home advantage in sports. Using the “natural exper- iment” of ghost games during the COVID-19 pandemic in German professional soccer and a dataset of 6,120 matches ranging over the seasons 2011/2012 to 2020/2021, we test this claim. Indeed, applying a difference-in-differences setup, we identify a reduction in the home performance - though with much heterogeneity across leagues and teams. We, moreover, observe the home advantage to recover over time. In analysing whether betting markets anticipated this drop in the home advantage and its recovery, we test the efficient market hypothesis. In the short-run, betting odds do not properly reflect the effect of ghost games regarding changes in the home advantage but they suitably account for it in the long-run. Also, league heterogeneity is efficiently captured in the odds. Based on these findings, we show how simple, short-run betting strategies could have exploited the discussed phenomenon. Our findings also have implications for agents' behavior on financial markets in the presence of unforeseen and unfamiliar shocks. © 2022 The Authors.

,Goal or Miss? A Bernoulli Distribution for In-Game Outcome Prediction in Soccer,"Due to a colossal soccer market, soccer analysis has attracted considerable attention from industry and academia. In-game outcome prediction has great potential in various applications such as game broadcasting, tactical decision making, and betting. In some sports, the method of directly predicting in-game outcomes based on the ongoing game state is already being used as a statistical tool. However, soccer is a sport with low-scoring games and frequent draws, which makes in-game prediction challenging. Most existing studies focus on pre-game prediction instead. This paper, however, proposes a two-stage method for soccer in-game outcome prediction, namely in-game outcome prediction (IGSOP). When the full length of a soccer game is divided into sufficiently small time frames, the goal scored by each team in each time frame can be modeled as a random variable following the Bernoulli distribution. In the first stage, IGSOP adopts state-based machine learning to predict the probability of a scoring goal in each future time frame. In the second stage, IGSOP simulates the remainder of the game to estimate the outcome of a game. This two-stage approach effectively captures the dynamic situation after a goal and the uncertainty in the late phase of a game. Chinese Super League data have been used for algorithm training and evaluation, and the results demonstrate that IGSOP outperforms existing methods, especially in predicting draws and prediction during final moments of games. IGSOP provides a novel perspective to solve the problem of in-game outcome prediction in soccer, which has a potential ripple effect on related research. © 2022 by the authors.",10.3390/e24070971,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85136349030&doi=10.3390%2fe24070971&partnerID=40&md5=9b66b37fe8ea3dfb6ac2e5a2a2eacdcf,SCOPUS,Si,Metodo en 2 etapas de prediccion de partidos de futbol,"MAE, RMSE, r2, rank probability score, Calibration","XGBoost, Ridge Regression, Random Forest, Bayesian Ridge Regression, IGSOP, Linear Regression - OLS (Ordinary Least Squares)",Fútbol,Chinese Super League,masculino,,,1820,"Home form Away form Form differential

Javier,Professional male modern boxing: An analysis of activity profile by category; [Boxeo moderno masculino profesional: un análisis del perfil de actividad por categoría],"The purpose of this study is to examine modern professional male boxing by analyzing world champions differences between winners and losers by categories. 322 male professional boxers (age 28.95 ± 4.10, height 175.26 ± 9.44 cm, and weight 147.82 ± 31.31 lb) were included in this observational descriptive analysis, through 320 fights separated by weight divisions [Heavy (H) (n = 24), Cruiser (C) (n = 48), Light Heavy (LH) (n = 62), Super Middle Weight (SMW) (n = 17), Middle Weight (MW) (n = 68), Light Middle Weight (LMW) (n = 42), Welter Weight (WW) (n = 49), Light Welter Weight (LWW) (n = 28), Light Welter (LW) (n = 33), Super Feather Weight (SFW) (n = 63), Feather Weight (FW) (n = 66), Super Bantam Weight (SBW) (n = 42), Bantam Weight (BW) (n = 30), Super Fly Weight (SFLW) (n = 39), Flyweight (F) (n = 29)]. Differences were found between winners and losers (U = 57804 - 90908.5; p <.001; d = 0.129 - 0.776) for all the variables analyzed. Four significant correlations were highlighted: %PL (Percentage of Punches Landed) (rho = .630); AVG PLxR (Punches Landed Per Round) (rho = .594); AVG PPLxR (Power Punches Landed Per Round) (rho = .517); %PPL (Percentage of Power Punches Landed) (rho = .672) and differences were also observed between weight categories (H = 32.29 - 93.11; p <.001 - .004), except for %PL, AVG JLxR, %JL (Percentage of Jabs Landed) and %PPL. This data suggests that in order to win these events, fighters must deliver precise punches, especially power punches, and that there are differences between the categories with this type of punch (AVG PPLxR). © Copyright: Federación Española de Asociaciones de Docentes de Educación Física (FEADEF).",10.47197/retos.v50.99923,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85173492127&doi=10.47197%2fretos.v50.99923&partnerID=40&md5=bced1eac1add62c4165b4fbd7015c4c7,SCOPUS,No,Diferencias entre ganadores y perdedores de combates de boxeo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Javier,DETERMINATION OF MODEL CHARACTERISTICS AND EVALUATION CRITERIA FOR STRENGTH TRAINING OF QUALIFIED ARMWRESTLING STUDENT-ATHLETES; [ВИЗНАЧЕННЯ МОДЕЛЬНИХ ПОКАЗНИКІВ Й ОЦІНОЧНИХ КРИТЕРІЇВ СИЛОВОЇ ПІДГОТОВЛЕНОСТІ КВАЛІФІКОВАНИХ СТУДЕНТІВ-АРМРЕСТЛЕРІВ],"Research purpose. The aim of the study was to determine the model indicators of strength readiness of qualified armwrestling student-athletes in the weight category from 80 to 100 kg in 4 strength exercises: flexion of the fingers, stretch with a hammer, hook and bending of the hand. Materials and Methods. The study involved 16 qualified armwrestling student-athletes weighing from 80 to 100 kg (M = 86,63 kg), 7 of which are participants of national championships of Ukraine, and 9 of which are prize-winners of competitions of regional level. During the study, strength indicators were determined in 4 competitive exercises. Strength indices in all test exercises were measured in a static mode by an FB5k series digital force gauge (Poland) with an accuracy class of up to 100 g, which was mounted on a special armwrestling table using a specially made block device. The created design was called the “ARM1 Device” (patent 43082). During the statistical analysis, the following parameters were calculated: arithmetic mean (M), standard deviation (σ), error of representativeness (m) and the coefficient of variation (V). Results. The analysis of the strength capabilities of the qualified student-armwrestlers and the presented models of their strength readiness made it possible to develop assessment criteria for the level of strength readiness of the qualified student-armwrestlers. Three levels of strength readiness have been identified: low (M - σ), high (M + σ) and medium, i.e. more than (M - σ) but less than (M + σ). Comparative analysis of the ratios of different levels of strength training in this group of armwrestling athletes allowed to determine from 128 indicators of strength 14.84% (n = 19) of low level, 62.50% (n = 80) of medium level and 22.66% (n = 29) of high level. Conclusions. The study made it possible to establish the features of the levels of development of strength training of qualified armwrestling athletes weighing from 80 to 100 kg. The model indicators of strength training of qualified armwrestlers were also determined. The analysis found that the subject athletes have an insufficient level of strength training and are not fully realized in terms of strength capabilities (62.50% indicators of the average level of strength). © 2022 Teoria ta Metodika Fizicnogo Vihovanna.

Javier,World and European Rowing Medallists Pace With Smaller Variation Than Their Competitors,"Purpose: To establish the relation between pacing pattern and performance, within sex, and number of crew members, at the very highest performance level in World class rowing. Methods: Pacing profiles based on official 500 m split times in 106 A-finals with six contesting boat crews (n = 636 crews), in recent World (2017–2019) and European (2017–2021) championships, were analyzed. The coefficient of variation (CV) and sum of relative differences (SRD) of the split times, and normalized velocities in the four segments of the race, were compared between performance levels, that is, placement (1st–6th), and subgroups based on sex (female or male) and number of crew members (one, two, or four). Statistical tests and resulting p-values and effect sizes (Cohen's d) were used to assess differences between groups. Results: The pacing profiles of the medallists had smaller variation than those of the non-podium finishers (CV = 1.72% vs. CV = 2.00%; p = 4 × 10−7, d = 0.41). Compared to the non-podium finishers, the medallists had lower normalized velocities in the first and second segments of the race, slightly higher in the third segment and higher in the fourth segment. Female crews paced somewhat more evenly than male crews. No significant differences were found in the evenness of pacing profiles between singles, doubles/pairs and quads/fours. Analyses of SRD were overall consistent with analyses of CV. Conclusion: Medal winners in major rowing championships use a more even pacing strategy than their final competitors, which could imply that such a strategy is advantageous in rowing.

Javier,Comparison of Race Time-Differences Between and Within Para and Able-Bodied Cross-Country Skiers,"Purpose: To compare differences in race time (i.e., the average percent difference in race time for each skier compared to the winner, RTdiffs) between female and male Para and able-bodied (AB) skiers, and to examine whether RTdiffs change across seasons. Methods: Race data from World Cups (WCs), World Championships (WCHs), and Paralympic/Olympic Winter Games (PWG/OWGs) of the 2011–2020 seasons was extracted from the website of the International Paralympic Committee and the International Ski Federation. All individual distance races for female and male visually impaired standing (VI), physically impaired sitting (SIT) and standing (STAND), and AB skiers with ≥10 competitors were included in the analyses. We investigated the main effect of skiing groups (i.e., VI, STAND, SIT, and AB skiers) and sex on RTdiffs for top-3 and top-8 skiers. Furthermore, the main effect of season and skiing group on RTdiffs for top-3 and top-8 skiers were investigated. All models were adjusted for distance, skiing style (classical- and freestyle), and event type (WC, WCH, and PWG/OWG). Results: RTdiffs were significantly larger in Para compared to AB skiers (top-3: 2.1 vs. 0.9%; top-8: 6.2 vs. 2.1%, all p < 0.01), and in female compared to male skiers (top-3: 1.8 vs. 1.3%; top-8: 4.9 vs. 3.5%, all p < 0.05). For top-3 skiers, RTdiffs did not significantly differ between the Para categories (all p > 0.2), while for top-8 skiers RTdiffs were significantly larger for VI compared to SIT and STAND (7.0 vs. 5.5 and 5.6%, respectively, all p < 0.05). RTdiffs were stable across the 2011–2020 seasons for top-3 skiers (VI: 1.7–3.6%, STAND: 1.1–2.2%, SIT: 1.0–3.9%, AB: 0.4–1.1%; all p > 0.1) and top-8 skiers (VI: 3.4–12.0%, STAND: 2.6–5.7%, SIT: 1.9–5.9%, AB: 0.1–1.7%; all p > 0.1). Conclusion: The larger RTdiffs in Para compared to AB skiers indicate larger variability in performance, which are in part disability related. Female skiers displayed larger RTdiffs than their male counterparts, indicating larger variability in performance among the female skiers. Our results provide insights about performance demands in Para cross-country skiing, which is of relevance for coaches and skiers.

Javier,Analysis of challenge request success according to contextual variables in elite badminton; [Beantragung einer Analyse des Challenge-Erfolgs durch kontextuelle Variablen beim Elite-Badminton],"Badminton has evolved into a blink-and-miss event, with powerful smashes dominating rallies. Due to the fact that the speed of smashes has increased, there are controversial decisions when the shuttlecock hits the ground during the match. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to identify the importance of challenge request effectiveness in elite badminton according to contextual-related variables. The sample was composed of 56 shuttlecock challenges requested during 20 matches (quarter-final, semi-final or final matches) from the Olympic Games (Rio de Janeiro, 2016) and the Word Badminton Championship (Glasgow, 2017). The Crosstabs-Command and the Binomial logistic regression were applied in order to identify the interactive effects on challenge success of each contextual variable (gender, requester player, next point winner, score-line, game, game interval, games in favor, challenges left per game, match-outcome and player’s international experience). The main results identified that the success of a challenge is affected by the request with less efficiency when the player requests the hawk-eye (odds ratio [OR] = 0.65) and when the player that request the hawk-eye is the loser of the match (OR = 0.21). The identified trends allow players to improve strategic plans that involve selecting the most appropriate moment to request the calling Line Review. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Deutschland, ein Teil von Springer Nature.",10.1007/s12662-019-00591-4,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85067037150&doi=10.1007%2fs12662-019-00591-4&partnerID=40&md5=7bbce42dc68cb598cce3d7eaaeab9528,SCOPUS,No,Importancia de efectividad a la hora de solicitar challenge en badminton,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this paper we describe a framework for extracting shot detection by using the threshold values of diverse statistical features for raw video frames. Two different types of sports videos viz. soccer and basketball are used for assessment. The approach exploits correlation, maximum histogram difference and running average difference as the classifiers. The results are evaluated by selection of appropriate threshold of these features after training of framework. The winner take-all selection scheme is applied if correlation coefficient and histogram difference features are unable to identify the shot detection.

Javier,Gambling with leadership succession in Brazilian football: head coach turnovers and team performance,"Purpose: Although leadership succession is a popular area of study across different professional sports leagues, existing research has largely ignored South America despite Brazilian football seeming to surpass the limits of coaching turnovers in comparison to any other league worldwide. Design/methodology/approach: This study examines the causes and consequences of 594 head coach turnovers in the Brasileirão from 2003 to 2018. A comprehensive longitudinal dataset was compiled (n = 13,012) and a series of regression analysis evaluated the determinants of coaching replacements as well as their effect on team performance. Findings: Statistical results revealed that coaching survival is significantly determined by a negative spell of three to four games, parallel competitions and performance expectations with three games in advance. Regarding performance outcomes, it takes seven games for a slight sign of improvement to be identified after a coach turnover, but no clear positive effects are recognized as an aftermath, supporting the ritual scapegoating theory. Practical implications: The findings suggest that decision makers should consider the importance of a rational evaluation and the crucial component of time instead of judging coaches based on subjectivity and immediate results. Meanwhile, coaches should avoid voluntary turnovers, exercising priorities ahead of continental cups and sequences with few points accumulated. Originality/value: This investigation discloses a valuable reference for coaches, sport managers and academic scholars interested in Brazilian football, as it extends knowledge development and theoretical understanding for a region that still lacks scientific evidence to back up its practical assumptions in sports. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",10.1108/SBM-06-2020-0059,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85097609637&doi=10.1108%2fSBM-06-2020-0059&partnerID=40&md5=3e73a83247fab813142d19c3f55cf97e,SCOPUS,Podría Ser,Relación entre cambio de entrenador y mejora en rendimiento equipo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Javier,Eigenvalues make the difference – A network analysis of the Chinese Super League,"To evaluate collective (macro) performance data in the Chinese Super League, social network analyses and graph theory were implemented in team sports performance analyses. For each team, we constructed a weighted and directed network in which nodes corresponded to players and arrows to passes. A total of 1200 matches during the 2014–2018 seasons were analysed. The results showed significant differences in general network measures among team competitive levels, match locations and match outcomes. Successful teams and home teams had significantly higher link, diameter, density and cluster coefficient values than did the unsuccessful teams or visiting teams; however, the winning teams had significantly lower density and cluster coefficient 2 values than did the losing teams. This study suggested that successful teams or teams with advantages (home, winner) have a high level of total passes and eigenvalues. This is the first report in which eigenvalues (the degree of a team’s distribution of the ball during the match) were able to capture changes in dynamics between different teams. There were positive correlations between all the network variables and the total shots and no correlations between all the network variables and goals. © The Author(s) 2020.",10.1177/1747954120908822,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85081577158&doi=10.1177%2f1747954120908822&partnerID=40&md5=deadebaa367ad08f605dd37a0616b8d6,SCOPUS,Podría Ser,"Rendimiento colectivo basada en teoría de grafos, donde nodos son jugadores y vertices los pases",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,Predicting the Result of English Premier League Matches,"Nowadays predictive models or prediction of results in any sports become popular in data mining community, and particularly, English Premier League (EPL) in football gains way much attention in the past few years. There are three main approaches to predict the results: statistical approaches, machine learning approaches, and the Bayesian approaches. In this paper, the approach used is machine learning and evaluating all features that influences the results and attempts to choose the most significant features that lead a football team to win, lose, or draw and even considering the top teams. This predictive model basically helps in betting areas and also for managers to have a knowledge how to set up their team by analyzing the results also companies like StatsBomb which use these kinds of tools for setting up scouting networks for searching of hidden gems throughout the world. These features help predict the best possible outcome of the EPL matches using these classifiers logistic regression, support vector machine, random forest, and XGBoost; the data used for prediction is selected from the Web site: datahub.io, and the model is based on the data of last ten seasons of EPL.

Javier,Fast Sparse Deep Neural Network Inference with Flexible SpMM Optimization Space Exploration,"Deep neural networks (DNN) have been widely used in many fields. With the ever-increasing model size, the DNN scalability suffers. Sparse deep neural networks (SpDNN) are promising to resolve this problem, but the sparse data makes it difficult to execute efficiently on GPUs due to load imbalance and irregular memory accesses. The recent MIT/IEEE/Amazon GraphChallenge has shown several big advances to fit sparse DNNs into GPUs, but we observe that none of these earlier efforts can be an absolute winner for all dataset cases due to their limited optimization space considerations. In this paper, we identify some new opportunities in optimizing the execution of SpDNN via a comprehensive analysis of previous works. Based on this new large design space of SpDNN, we present sparsity-aware SpMM algorithms that can systematically explore a performance-optimal solution of SpDNN execution on GPU and further generate optimized SpMM kernel implementations.

Javier,"The report and analysis of the 2nd U21 European Deaf Football Championship, Stockholm, Sweden 2018","Purpose. Almost no studies have documented or analysed sporting events for deaf players at the elite level. the aim of the study was to report on the 2nd U21 European Deaf Football championship, analyse selected offensive actions and compare them with the 1st European Deaf sports Organization (EDsO) U21 championship and Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) U21 events (2015 and 2017), as well as create a ranking of finalists of the deaf U21 tournaments. Methods. counting analyses were performed on the basis of video recordings from the stadiums of 1st and 2nd EDsO U21. Nineteen matches were analysed with reference to the number of goals, shots on target, and shots missed. Results. the mean number of goals scored per match during the 2nd U21 (1st U21) championship was 2.25 ± 2.27/team (1.81 ± 1.53). the number of shots on target and missed was 8.1 ± 5.7/team/match (6.9 ± 4.9) and 6.2 ± 3.9/team/match (5.4 ± 3.7). In 1st and 2nd EDsO championships, the most offensive play was presented by the teams of Turkey, Poland, Russia, and Ukraine. Conclusions. the winner of the tournament was the team with the highest shooting efficiency and the highest number of crosses in all matches. the analyses of the 2nd U21 can be useful for the organization of coaching. Organizers of events for deaf athletes, however, do not pay much attention to careful registration of the event materials and match statistics, which are very important for the promotion of events for deaf athletes. © University school of Physical Education in Wroclaw",10.5114/hm.2019.83990,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85068682120&doi=10.5114%2fhm.2019.83990&partnerID=40&md5=ed3aa97b97cac6888379555a3562f111,SCOPUS,No,Analisis campeonato futbol para sordos 2018,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Javier,Are 800-m runners getting faster? Global competition performance trends between 1999 and 2021,"Research aim: The present study explored the trends in the global competition results of the 800-m event over the past two decades. The study tested the hypothesis that slow tactical racing has been less frequently pursued at the global competitions of the past years than previously. Materials and method: The sample included competitors participating in the World Championships and Olympic Games held between 1999 and 2021, including 16 men’s events and 13 women’s events (N = 1000). The data analysis focused on the results and seasonal bests (SB) of those proceeding from the two qualifying rounds by rank or result (Q; q) and of medal winners of the finals. Furthermore, the two indices were combined into a percentage SB index (%SB) for each participant. Mean comparisons between male and female competitors and between medal winners and non-winners were conducted with independent samples t-tests. The possible trends in the competitors’ results were explored with polynomial trendlines fitted to the observed data. Results: Neither of the three indices showed an improving trend over the past two decades among either men or women. Those proceeding from the qualifying rounds and medal winners gradually approached their best performance in each round, reaching peak performance in the finals (%SB: Qualifying rounds: Men: 98.35±0.41%; Women: 98.31±0.80%; Semifinals: Men: 99.10±0.60%; Women: 99.52±0.89%; Finals: Men: 99.45±1.07%; Women: 100.04±1.07%). Conclusions: No improving trend is observable in performance at the global 800-m competitions of the past two decades. Competitors gradually approach their best performance in each round, reaching peak performance in the finals. This is probably due to the three-round procedure of global competitions held over the past two decades. In the finals, men are equally likely to pursue slow tactical racing (2000, 2009, 2021) and to achieve new records (1999, 2012, 2016, 2019), whereas women are less likely to engage in slow tactical racing (except in 2003 and 2005). All those competing in the finals possess highly equal skills, thus pursuing adequate racing tactics is indispensable for medal winning. © 2022, Editura Universitatii din Pitesti.

Javier,Studying the priority of technical-tactical actions fulfillment among highly-qualified belt wrestlers during competitive activity,"Dynamically developing kind of sport “Belt wrestling” undergoes serious changes nowadays in the structure of competitive combats and it makes specialists study combats and search for new ways of improving the forms and content of wrestlers’ technical and tactical training. This article studies an urgent question of techniques fulfillment priority by highly-qualified belt wrestlers in the final combats of the biggest International competitions. From the held analysis of 48 combats among belt wrestlers during the final part of three World Cups and three World Championships among 18-20 year-old juniors we define 6 most frequently used techniques. They were used by the winners of the competitions. The article also presents detailed analysis of the held technical-tactical actions indices during the combat and the received for them points among highly-qualified wrestlers. It was stated that highly-qualified belt wrestlers have a wide arsenal of technical means for an effective fulfillment of technical-tactical actions during important combats. At the same time, we underline that in the held by them combats attacking and executing a counterattack actions prevail and wrestlers organize the combat in power oriented, aggressive and attacking manner. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.",10.1051/bioconf/20202600026,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85201976041&doi=10.1051%2fbioconf%2f20202600026&partnerID=40&md5=157a7bca2dcd9ee382da2c4742d015dc,SCOPUS,No,Analisis de la técninas utilizadas en combates de lucha por el cinturon,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Javier,THE ROLE OF INTRINSIC DIMENSION IN HIGH-RESOLUTION PLAYER TRACKING DATA—INSIGHTS IN BASKETBALL,"Following the introduction of high-resolution player tracking technology, a new range of statistical analysis has emerged in sports, specifically in basketball. However, such high-dimensional data are often challenging for statistical inference and decision making. In this article we employ a state-of-the-art Bayesian mixture model that allows the estimation of heterogeneous intrinsic dimension (ID) within a dataset, and we propose some theoretical enhancements. Informally, the ID can be seen as an indicator of complexity and dependence of the data at hand, and it is usually assumed unique. Our method provides the capacity to reveal valuable insights about the hidden dynamics of sports interactions in space and time which helps to translate complex patterns into more coherent statistics. The application of this technique is illustrated using NBA basketball players’ tracking data, allowing effective classification and clustering. In movement data the analysis identified key stages of offensive actions, such as creating space for passing, preparation/shooting, and following through which are relevant for invasion sports. We found that the ID value spikes, reaching a peak between four and eight seconds in the offensive part of the court, after which it declines. In shot charts we obtained groups of shots that produce substantially higher and lower successes. Overall, game-winners tend to have a larger intrinsic dimension, indicative of greater unpredictability and unique shot placements. Similarly, we found higher ID values in plays when the score margin is smaller rather than larger. The exploitation of these results can bring clear strategic advantages in sports games. © Institute of Mathematical Statistics, 2022.",10.1214/21-AOAS1506,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85127778440&doi=10.1214%2f21-AOAS1506&partnerID=40&md5=e6792214be13c12750a230265926e288,SCOPUS,No,Análisis con método bayesiano sobre de datos de seguimiento de jugador de nba,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Predicting the winning team in basketball: A novel approach,"Predicting the winner of a basketball game is a difficult task, due to the inherent complexity of team sports. All 10 players on the court interact with each other and this intricate web of relationships makes the prediction task difficult, especially if the prediction model aims to account for how different players amplify or inhibit other players. Building our approach on complex systems and prototype heuristics, we identify player types through clustering and use cluster memberships to train prediction models. We achieve a prediction accuracy of ∼76% over a period of five NBA seasons and a prediction accuracy of ∼71% over a season not used for model training. Our best models outperform human experts on prediction accuracy. Our research contributes to the literature by showing that player stereotypes extracted from individual statistics are a valid approach to predict game winners. © 2022 The Author(s)",10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e12189,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85143980347&doi=10.1016%2fj.heliyon.2022.e12189&partnerID=40&md5=487d8dd789718539a3e7d598a0be363a,SCOPUS,Si,Prediccion de partidos de baloncetos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Javier,A Review of Competitive Balance in European Football Leagues before and after Financial Fair Play Regulations,"This paper analyses competitive balance in 24 top-division domestic football leagues in Europe before and after the implementation of UEFA’s Financial Fair Play (FFP) regulations. Our analysis covers 22 seasons between 2000/01 and 2021/22 and utilises indicators of overall league concentration and dominance. Seven of the 24 leagues examined have seen a statistically significant worsening of league concentration post-FFP, fourteen leagues experienced a decline in the number of top-four finishers and thirteen saw a reduction in the number of unique title winners. The weight of evidence indicates that FFP has adversely affected competitive balance in several European football leagues. © 2023 by the authors.",10.3390/su15054284,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85149654701&doi=10.3390%2fsu15054284&partnerID=40&md5=b6fa79dc4fba5b941e1999fdc8b24886,SCOPUS,No,Efecto en equilibrio en 24 ligas de paises tras imposcion del fair play financiero de la uefa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Javier,Technical and tactical discriminatory factors between winners and defeated elite karate athletes,"Purpose: To assess the technical and tactical demands of elite karate athletes in relation to 3 match sequences (ie, advantage, disadvantage, and drawing) and match outcome (ie, win/defeat). Methods: One hundred twenty elite seniors' (60 men and 60 women) World Karate Federation combats were analyzed during 2 World Championships (2012 and 2014). Specific karate attributes (strategy, technique, tactic, target, and effectiveness) were evaluated and classified into 3 sequences: advantage, disadvantage, and drawing. Results: Karatekas performed more combination techniques in disadvantage sequences than in drawing sequences (P = .011). A higher number of timed-attack actions were reported during advantage sequences than during drawing sequences (P = .048). Winners of the whole combat had higher lower-limb technique rate (1.0 [0.9] vs 0.1 [0.3]; P = .044) and less rate of timed attack (0.3 [0.5] vs 0.6 [1.0]; P = .030) than defeated karatekas during advantage and drawing sequences, respectively. Conclusions: Winners used higher lower-limb technique and less timed-attack rates than defeated karatekas in advantage and drawing sequences, respectively. Indeed, using lower-limb technique during advantageous situations could be a powerful strategy to increase the lead. Therefore, it seems fundamental for coaches of top elite karatekas to put their athletes in simulated situations and push them to increase their use of lower-limb techniques. © 2019 Human Kinetics, Inc.",10.1123/ijspp.2018-0478,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85065345335&doi=10.1123%2fijspp.2018-0478&partnerID=40&md5=7aed41b5d343116b17a53ea2146c8083,SCOPUS,No,Necesidades técnicas y tácticas en combates de karate,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Javier,Analysis of internal and external loads in official ultimate frisbee competition: A comparison match performance outcome and playing position,"In this study, we examined and compared internal and external loads during an official Ultimate Frisbee (UF) competition, focusing on match performance outcomes and playing positions. The research involved 56 UF players from 8 teams competing in mixed-gender championship Thailand. Each team comprised 4 male and 3 female players, and all participants were observed across 4 competitive matches, including the first round, quarterfinals, semifinals, and finals. The heart rate and distance covered in each speed zone were collected using Polar Team Pro™ throughout 4 official matches, After each match, athletes were separated for statistical analysis based on performance (winners vs. losers) and position (handler, cutter, and deeper positions). Data were analyzed using mean, standard deviation, independent t-test, and one-way ANOVA. All tests used the 0.05 level of significance. The results showed that for the winners, the HR (heart rate), % HRmax, distance covered, and number of sprints were higher (P<0.05) than for the losers; in addition, the winners spent more (P<0.05) time at high intensity and very high-intensity levels than the losers, as well as more (P<0.05) time doing high-speed running and sprinting than the losers. Comparing the playing positions in the match, the deeper was higher (P<0.05) than the handler and cutter positions, as well as spending more (P<0.05) time at high intensity, very high intensity, high-speed running and sprinting levels than the handler and cutter positions. The data from this study should be helpful for coaches and athletes for the development of a specific training program to improve the performance of UF players, which is an essential instrument in the modern planning and application of training loads. © JPES.",10.7752/jpes.2024.05149,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85196092562&doi=10.7752%2fjpes.2024.05149&partnerID=40&md5=f2e0894bb0b23f7b3c109391030dbffb,SCOPUS,No,Estudio de competición de frisbee comparando el rendimineto y posicion de los jugadores y las cargas internas y externas,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Javier,Epigenetic targets in B- and T-cell lymphomas: latest developments,"Non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas (NHLs) comprise a diverse group of diseases, either of mature B-cell or of T-cell derivation, characterized by heterogeneous molecular features and clinical manifestations. While most of the patients are responsive to standard chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radiation and/or stem cell transplantation, relapsed and/or refractory cases still have a dismal outcome. Deep sequencing analysis have pointed out that epigenetic dysregulations, including mutations in epigenetic enzymes, such as chromatin modifiers and DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), are prevalent in both B- cell and T-cell lymphomas. Accordingly, over the past decade, a large number of epigenetic-modifying agents have been developed and introduced into the clinical management of these entities, and a few specific inhibitors have already been approved for clinical use. Here we summarize the main epigenetic alterations described in B- and T-NHL, that further supported the clinical development of a selected set of epidrugs in determined diseases, including inhibitors of DNMTs, histone deacetylases (HDACs), and extra-terminal domain proteins (bromodomain and extra-terminal motif; BETs). Finally, we highlight the most promising future directions of research in this area, explaining how bioinformatics approaches can help to identify new epigenetic targets in B- and T-cell lymphoid neoplasms. © The Author(s), 2023.",10.1177/20406207231173485,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85161310903&doi=10.1177%2f20406207231173485&partnerID=40&md5=6776c17132cc7de8e3dc4b9044c4bc27,SCOPUS,No,NHL pero no relacionado con el deporte,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Javier,The importance of betting early,"We evaluate the impact of timing on decision outcomes when both the timing and the relevant decision are chosen under uncertainty. Sports betting provides the testing ground, as we exploit an original dataset containing more than one million online bets on games of the Italian Major Soccer League. We find that individuals perform systematically better when they place their bets farther away from the game day. The better performance of early bettors holds controlling for (time-invariant) unobservable ability, learning during the season, and timing of the odds. We attribute this result to the increase of noisy information on game day, which hampers the capacity of late (non-professional) bettors to use very simple prediction methods, such as team rankings or last game results. We also find that more successful bettors tend to bet in advance, focus on a smaller set of events, and prefer games associated with smaller betting odds. © 2021 by the authors.

,A Comprehensive Data Pipeline for Comparing the Effects of Momentum on Sports Leagues,"Momentum has been a consistently studied aspect of sports science for decades. Among the established literature, there has, at times, been a discrepancy between conclusions. However, if momentum is indeed an actual phenomenon, it would affect all aspects of sports, from player evaluation to pre-game prediction and betting. Therefore, using momentum-based features that quantify a team’s linear trend of play, we develop a data pipeline that uses a small sample of recent games to assess teams’ quality of play and measure the predictive power of momentum-based features versus the predictive power of more traditional frequency-based features across several leagues using several machine learning techniques. More precisely, we use our pipeline to determine the differences in the predictive power of momentum-based features and standard statistical features for the National Hockey League (NHL), National Basketball Association (NBA), and five major first-division European football leagues. Our findings show little evidence that momentum has superior predictive power in the NBA. Still, we found some instances of the effects of momentum on the NHL that produced better pre-game predictors, whereas we view a similar trend in European football/soccer. Our results indicate that momentum-based features combined with frequency-based features could improve pre-game prediction models and that, in the future, momentum should be studied more from a feature/performance indicator point-of-view and less from the view of the dependence of sequential outcomes, thus attempting to distance momentum from the binary view of winning and losing. © 2024 by the authors.",10.3390/data9020029,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85185840126&doi=10.3390%2fdata9020029&partnerID=40&md5=53501d27e784cb97aeb5d40326072c28,SCOPUS,Si,Importancia de Momentum en la predicción de resultados,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Javier,Relation of Offensive Performance during Exclusions and Final Ranking in Female Handball,"The aim of this study was to determine team offensive performance indicators during exclusions related to the final ranking obtained in the tournament. Twenty-nine matches from the 2017 Pan-American Female Championship played by 10 national teams were analyzed using observational methodology. Cramer’s V and Fisher’s exact test were applied to identify associations between the variables. The Chaid algorithm was used to identify performance variables during inequality situations associated with the final ranking. Results showed that teams ranked 1st to 3rd presented a statistically significant relationship (p < 0.001; ASR 5.2) of being in superiority, scoring on 56.8% of their finalizations, while teams ranked 7th to 10 th showed a tendency of ending their attacks in turnovers under inequality situations (p < 0.00; ASR 3.1). Playing with an empty net during inferiority situations was a predictor of winners belonging to the medalist teams in 76.2% of the analyzed situations. It can be concluded that during numerical superiority, the best-ranked teams better handled their possessions. The substitution of the goalkeeper for a court player during inferiority was a predictor of belonging to the medalist group. Playing with the goalkeeper in goal (playing 5 against 6) when the match status was balanced or unbalanced, was a predictor of losing teams that did not end up in the medalist groups. © 2022 by the authors.",10.3390/app122110774,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85141857968&doi=10.3390%2fapp122110774&partnerID=40&md5=581280ae4d71f5efe0b29715f6d1652d,SCOPUS,No,Rendimiento deportivo en situaciones de superioridad numérica en balonmano femenino,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Javier,Using machine learning pipeline to predict entry into the attack zone in football,"Sports sciences are increasingly data-intensive nowadays since computational tools can extract information from large amounts of data and derive insights from athlete performances during the competition. This paper addresses a performance prediction problem in soccer, a popular collective sport modality played by two teams competing against each other in the same field. In a soccer game, teams score points by placing the ball into the opponent’s goal and the winner is the team with the highest count of goals. Retaining possession of the ball is one key to success, but it is not enough since a team needs to score to achieve victory, which requires an offensive toward the opponent’s goal. The focus of this work is to determine if analyzing the first five seconds after the control of the ball is taken by one of the teams provides enough information to determine whether the ball will reach the final quarter of the soccer field, therefore creating a goal-scoring chance. By doing so, we can further investigate which conditions increase strategic leverage. Our approach comprises modeling players’ interactions as graph structures and extracting metrics from these structures. These metrics, when combined, form time series that we encode in two-dimensional representations of visual rhythms, allowing feature extraction through deep convolutional networks, coupled with a classifier to predict the outcome (whether the final quarter of the field is reached). The results indicate that offensive play near the adversary penalty area can be predicted by looking at the first five seconds. Finally, the explainability of our models reveals the main metrics along with its contributions for the final inference result, which corroborates other studies found in the literature for soccer match analysis. © 2023 Stival et al.

Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 21 national team members. After players’ discourses underwent thematic analysis, analytic categories were subjected to Pierre Bourdieu’s Theory of Fields. According to players, futsal is discredited in sports media coverage, hampering the attraction of investors and career development.

,Incremental Learning for Football Match Outcomes Prediction,"Generating predictions for football match results is an expanding research area due to the commercial assets involved in the betting process. Traditionally, the results of the matches are predicted using statistical models verified by domain experts. Nowadays, this approach is challenged by the increasing amount of diverse football related information that need to be processed. In this paper, we propose an incremental learning method to predict the football match outcome category (home win, draw, away win) based on prior to the game publicly available information. The proposed framework is illustrated with data for the Portuguese first division football teams for 2017/2018 season. Factor Analysis was applied to extract most discriminating features which allowed gradual convergence of the prediction error to 32.4% after accumulation of about one third of the season games. Our approach outperforms traditional models in the gambling industry today and implies potential financial opportunities. The proposed prediction model is useful for researchers, football betting crowd, bookmakers, sport managers. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",10.1007/978-3-030-31321-0_19,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85076083123&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-030-31321-0_19&partnerID=40&md5=263d44c368e96c43f43ed4cfcf852b90,SCOPUS,Si,"Aprendizaje incremental para predecir si empate, victoria local o visitante",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Javier,A Phase I/II Open-Label Study of Molibresib for the Treatment of Relapsed/Refractory Hematologic Malignancies,"Purpose: Molibresib is a selective, small molecule inhibitor of the bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) protein family. This was an open-label, two-part, Phase I/II study investigating molibresib monotherapy for the treatment of hematological malignancies (NCT01943851). Patients and Methods: Part 1 (dose escalation) determined the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of molibresib in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), or multiple myeloma. Part 2 (dose expansion) investigated the safety and efficacy of molibresib at the RP2D in patients with relapsed/refractory myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS; as well as AML evolved from antecedent MDS) or cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). The primary endpoint in Part 1 was safety and the primary endpoint in Part 2 was objective response rate (ORR). Results: There were 111 patients enrolled (87 in Part 1, 24 in Part 2). Molibresib RP2Ds of 75 mg daily (for MDS) and 60 mg daily (for CTCL) were selected. Most common Grade 3+ adverse events included thrombocytopenia (37%), anemia (15%), and febrile neutropenia (15%). Six patients achieved complete responses [3 in Part 1 (2 AML, 1 NHL), 3 in Part 2 (MDS)], and 7 patients achieved partial responses [6 in Part 1 (4 AML, 2 NHL), 1 in Part 2 (MDS)]. The ORRs for Part 1, Part 2, and the total study population were 10% [95% confidence interval (CI), 4.8-18.7], 25% (95% CI, 7.3-52.4), and 13% (95% CI, 6.9-20.6), respectively. Conclusions: While antitumor activity was observed with molibresib, use was limited by gastrointestinal and thrombocytopenia toxicities. Investigations of molibresib as part of combination regimens may be warranted. © 2022 TheAuthors.",10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-22-1284,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85148250544&doi=10.1158%2f1078-0432.CCR-22-1284&partnerID=40&md5=ac924bba6f47bd30056c1fb76209ba6b,SCOPUS,No,BET es una proteina,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Dynamic Outcome Prediction of an NBA Match,"In this paper we formulate the problem of predicting the outcome (winner) of an ongoing National Basketball Association (NBA) match as a supervised machine learning problem. In this approach, as the match progresses, the outcome prediction dynamically adapts to the current match situation which does not happen in static prediction problems. Dynamic outcome prediction of the match seems to have received less attention in the literature than static predictions. We compute the features used in the classification problem based on the most up-to-date match situation till that point in time. A total of 32 features are used. We present results for all the regular season matches of the 2022–23 NBA season. Dynamic prediction accuracy varies from about 62% at the beginning of the match to about 78% at the beginning of the final quarter of the match. We also evaluate feature importance in this classification problem.",10.1109/IMCOM60618.2024.10418437,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10418437,IEEE,Si,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"The impact of sleep behaviours, chronotype and time of match on the internal and external outcomes of a tennis match","Tennis match performance is often evaluated by a player's internal (heart rate) and external (match analytics) outcomes. Numerous factors could influence these outcomes, including the time of day, which may be advantageous or not depending on a player's chronotype. This study aimed to determine the influence time of day, chronotype and sleep–wake behaviour (SWB) had on internal and external outcomes of tennis matches. Twelve state-level male tennis players, with a mean age of 28 ± 7, stature of 183 ± 7 and body mass of 86.6 ± 17.4 wore an actigraph device and completed a sleep diary for the study duration. Based on rankings, players were paired against the same opponent and completed three tennis matches at 8:00 am, 2:00 pm and 8:00 pm, separated by a minimum of 48 h. Fatigue and chronotype, measured by the Fatigue Severity Scale, Morningness Eveningness Questionnaire and midsleep time, were assessed before matches; motivation, measured by the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory, was assessed after matches. During matches, players wore global positioning systems and heart rate monitors; the match analytics and players’ rate of perceived exertion were recorded. Increased unforced errors and decreased winners and forced errors were observed in the evening matches. Decreased total distance and rate of perceived exertion during the second set were found for the evening compared to morning and afternoon matches. Chronotype and sleep–wake behaviour had trivial to weak associations with internal and external outcomes. These results indicate that players and coaches should consider the match times when training for future tournaments. © The Author(s) 2022.",10.1177/17479541221130443,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85141371625&doi=10.1177%2f17479541221130443&partnerID=40&md5=bd94f91f194d9194fdf032109328d3c6,SCOPUS,Si,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Machine Learning Enabled Team Performance Analysis in the Dynamical Environment of Soccer,"Team sports can be viewed as dynamical systems unfolding in time and thus require tools and approaches congruent to the analysis of dynamical systems. The analysis of the pattern-forming dynamics of player interactions can uncover the clues to underlying tactical behaviour. This study aims to propose quantitative measures of a team's performance derived only using player interactions. Concretely, we segment the data into events ending with a goal attempt, that is, “$Shot$”. Using the acquired sequences of events, we develop a coarse-grain activity model representing a player-to-player interaction network. We derive measures based on information theory and total interaction activity, to demonstrate an association with an attempt to score. In addition, we developed a novel machine learning approach to predict the likelihood of a team making an attempt to score during a segment of the match. Our developed prediction models showed an overall accuracy of 75.2% in predicting the correct segmental outcome from 13 matches in our dataset. The overall predicted winner of a match correlated with the true match outcome in 66.6% of the matches that ended in a result. Furthermore, the algorithm was evaluated on the largest available open collection of soccer logs. The algorithm showed an accuracy of 0.84 in the classification of the 42, 860 segments from 1, 941 matches and correctly predicted the match outcome in 81.9% of matches that ended in a result. The proposed measures of performance offer an insight into the underlying performance characteristics.",10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2992025,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9085411,IEEE,Si,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,How well do Elo-based ratings predict professional tennis matches?,"This paper examines the performance of five different measures for forecasting men's and women's professional tennis matches. We use data derived from every match played at the 2018 and 2019 Wimbledon tennis championships, the 2019 French Open, the 2019 US Open, and the 2020 Australian Open. We look at the betting odds, the official tennis rankings, the standard Elo ratings, surface-specific Elo ratings, and weighted composites of these ratings, including and excluding the betting odds. The performance indicators used are prediction accuracy, calibration, model discrimination, Brier score, and expected return. We find that the betting odds perform relatively well across these tournaments, while standard Elo (especially for women's tennis) and surface-adjusted Elo (especially for men's tennis) also perform well on a range of indicators. For all but the hard-court surfaces, a forecasting model which incorporates the betting odds tends also to perform well on some indicators. We find that the official ranking system proved to be a relatively poor measure of likely performance compared to betting odds and Elo-related methods. Our results add weight to the case for a wider use of Elo-based approaches within sports forecasting, as well as arguably within the player rankings methodologies.  © 2020 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2020.",10.1515/jqas-2019-0110,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85098993886&doi=10.1515%2fjqas-2019-0110&partnerID=40&md5=d4f31f58d60a1fc19c943e3822d07200,SCOPUS,Si,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Miguel,Beach volleyball spike arm swing techniques of Olympics and world championships winners (1996–2019) reveal gender differences,"The spike attack is one of the most important skills in beach volleyball, and as an overarm movement, places significant load on the shoulder joint that could lead to increased risk of injury. An analysis of the different techniques used by elite athletes could provide important insights regarding the etiology of these injuries. This study aimed to assess the spike attack arm swing techniques of Olympics and World Championships (1996-2019) beach volleyball winners and to investigate possible gender differences. Twenty-five male and twenty female winners were assessed on video recordings from eighteen competitions. The different arm swing techniques in the cocking phase (Straight, Bow-and-arrow high, Bow-and-arrow low, Snap, and Circular) were classified by two experts. Intra-rater reliability of both experts (κ = 1.000, P <.001 and κ =.969, P <.001 respectively) and inter-rater reliability (κ =.969, P <.001), assessed by Cohen’s Kappa, were almost perfect. There were significant gender differences in arm swing techniques (P <.001) with a large size effect (Cramer’s V =.650). The most frequent technique for men was the Bow-and-arrow low (56%) followed by Circular (24%) and Bow-and-arrow high (20%), while for women were the Bow-and-arrow high (30%) and Snap (30%), followed by Bow-and-arrow low (25%) and Straight (15%). The results showed a great variation in arm swing techniques even among world class beach volleyball players as well as significant gender differences, and could allow us to develop interesting hypotheses regarding the mechanisms that could lead to shoulder overuse injuries. © The Author(s) 2021.",10.1177/17479541211024151,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85107420651&doi=10.1177%2f17479541211024151&partnerID=40&md5=791127e8e950e8fdb42a3f4f7563d935,SCOPUS,No,"Se centra en estudiar el moviento del hombro en el volleyball, no es un término de estudio relevante en el ámbito de las apuestas",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Miguel,Offensive and defensive team performances: relation to successful and unsuccessful participation in the UEFA Champions League 20/21,"The primary factor that determines a football team's performance is its ability to score goals. Due to the rarity of successfully scored goals in a match, it is vital for teams to consistently create scoring opportunities while preventing their opponents from doing the same. The purpose of this study is to determine (1) the effect of offensive and defensive performance indicators on a team’s success and (2) the impact of the ‘first goal effect’ on the maches (for the team that scored the goal: win, draw or lose) in the UEFA Champions League 20/21. The sample of this study comprises 152 matches from the tournament's group and knockout phases. The performance indicators were fourteen selected offensive and defensive variables. The results of the study reveal that the successful teams had higher values (p < 0.05) in all offensive (except shots off goal for the team) and defensive (except the percentage of shots on goal against and percentage of shots off goal against) performance indicators than unsuccessful teams. In the group stage, the teams that scored first won 71.1% of their total matches (p < 0.001). In the knockout stage, the first goal effect had a greater impact on the outcome of matches than it did in the group stage (p < 0.001), as evidenced by the fact that, in 81.3% of the cases, the team that scored first won the match. Successful teams appear to perform better across the board in terms of offence and defence. This data directly impacts coaches, providing pertinent information for developing goal-scoring strategies. © 2022, Editura Universitatii din Pitesti.

Miguel,Analysis on Sports Data Match Result Prediction Using Machine Learning Libraries,"Two highly relevant aspects of football, namely forecasting of results and performance analysis by means of performance indicators, are combined in the present study by analysing the value of in-play information in terms of event and positional data in forecasting the further course of football matches. Event and positional data from 50 matches, including more than 300 million datapoints were used to extract a total of 18 performance indicators. Moreover, goals from more than 30,000 additional matches have been analysed. Results suggest that surprisingly goals do not possess any relevant informative value on the further course of a match, if controlling for pre-game market expectation by means of betting odds. Performance indicators based on event and positional data have been shown to possess more informative value than goals, but still are not sufficient to reveal significant predictive value in-play. The present results are relevant to match analysts and bookmakers who should not overestimate the value of in-play information when explaining match performance or compiling in-play betting odds. Moreover, the framework presented in the present study has methodological implications for performance analysis in football, as it suggests that researchers should increasingly segment matches by scoreline and control carefully for general team strength. © 2021, The Author(s).",10.1038/s41598-021-03157-3,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85121500171&doi=10.1038%2fs41598-021-03157-3&partnerID=40&md5=5132ee2194d511c6b938c4b1007a6607,SCOPUS,Podría Ser,,F1 Score,"Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, XGBoost",Fútbol,premiere league,masculino,No,Medias con anteriores partidos,15 temporaradas y 7 atributos por partido,"FTHG, FTAG FTR HTHG HTAG HTR Equipo Local visistante y árbitro",No se sabe,,"Busca encontrar el mejor modelo de aprendizaje automático para predecir el resultado de un partido cuando un equipo de la Premier League juega en casa, basándose en datos de temporadas anteriores",Victoria o Derrota,"0,56 F1 Score",Partidos anteriores,"2000/01, 2001/02, 2002/03, 2003/04, 2004/05, 2005/06, 2006/07, 2010/11 - 2017/18, 2007/08, 2008/09, 2009/10, 2018/19, 2017/18, 2016/17, 2015/16, 2014/15, 2010/11, 2013/14, 2011/12, 2012/13","S Kevin Andrews1*, K Lakshmi Narayanan2, K Balasubadra3, M S Josephine4 ",,No se especifican exactamente los atributos que se están utilizando ni como encontrarlos.
Miguel,Designing Robots to Best World Cup Winners has Inspired Generations of Roboticists,"FROM 2019 TO 2022, I had the privilege of serving as president of the RoboCup Federation. RoboCup is an annual international competitive event that merges visionary thinking about how AI and robotics will change the world with practical robot design. Participants spend months solving diverse technical problems to enable their robots to autonomously play soccer, do household chores, or search for disaster victims. And their efforts are in turn enabling fundamental advances in a range of fields, including machine learning, multiagent systems, and human-robot interaction. • RoboCup's original goal, as defined by founding president Hiroaki Kitano [right], was to enable a team of fully autonomous humanoid robots to beat the best human soccer team in the world on a real, outdoor field by the year 2050. Since the first RoboCup competition in 1997 which featured three leagues - small-size wheeled robots, middle-size wheeled robots, and simulation - the event has expanded to include humanoid robot soccer leagues, as well as other leagues devoted to robots with more immediate practicality. The next RoboCup event takes place in July in Bordeaux, France, where 2,500 humans (and 2,000 robots) from 45 countries are expected to compete.  © 1964-2012 IEEE.",10.1109/MSPEC.2023.10177053,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85165232736&doi=10.1109%2fMSPEC.2023.10177053&partnerID=40&md5=1a25ccc12f7f1979730229312e74434e,SCOPUS,No,"Habla sobre diseño de robots, no está centrado en el ámbito de las apuestas.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Miguel,Neuropsychological functions of nonverbal hand movements and gestures during sports,"Emotional body-distant gestures are a prominent feature of winning athletes. Because negative emotions have been associated to increased self-touch behaviour, we investigated the hypothesis that athletes change from a more body-distant nonverbal hand movement behaviour when winning to a body-focused behaviour when losing. Nonverbal hand movements of professional right-handed tennis athletes were video-taped during competition and analyzed by certified raters using the NEUROpsychological GESture(NEUROGES)System. The results showed that losing athletes increase their irregular, on body, and phasic on body hand movements, particularly with the left hand. Emotion / attitude rise gestures with the right hand characterised winning athletes. The data suggest that the nonverbal hand movements of athletes serve different neuropsychological functions. Winners nonverbally express their positive feelings by body-distant gestures but change towards their own body to regulate stress when losing.

Miguel,Validating a division I-A college football season simulation system,"NCAA division I-A college football remains the only major collegiate sport not to have a true playoff to determine its national champion. A controversial and flawed process termed the bowl championship series (BCS) has emerged with the goal of matching two teams in a so-called 'national championship' game.

The effectiveness of these computer models has never been empirically investigated in a controlled setting. This paper presents the development of a controlled test-bed of simulated college football seasons, a necessary preliminary step.

Miguel,‘Almost everybody does it … ’ gambling as future-making in Western Kenya,"This article discusses how Western Kenyans imagine and plan their futures in contrasting ways with a focus on three different gambling practices observed in a cluster of patrilineal homesteads. While participating in the national lottery entails an understanding of the future as organized by other actors and as, in principle, projectable, I analyse the practice of regularly placing low-risk bets on football games as a consequence of negating the possibility to plan one’s future in the long term. I lay bare a third conceptualization of the future by closely examining a betting ‘system’ one of my interlocutors had developed to hit a weekly jackpot. This conceptualization assumes that the future unfolds in ways that are, although very difficult to grasp, laid out in the present. The article concludes by distinguishing three ways in which gambling deals with the future, i.e. how it disclaims, upscales and invents the certainty of the future. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",10.1080/17531055.2019.1635818,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85068028739&doi=10.1080%2f17531055.2019.1635818&partnerID=40&md5=781531dc0d8515be93224852df2f24fb,SCOPUS,No,"Se centra en un análisis de la sociedad y sus comportamientos, especialmente haciendo una discusón sobre nuestro futuro.

Miguel,Next-Generation Models for Predicting Winning Times in Elite Swimming Events: Updated Predictions for the Paris 2024 Olympic Games,"Purpose: To evaluate statistical models developed for predicting medal-winning performances for international swimming events and generate updated performance predictions for the Paris 2024 Olympic Games. Methods: The performance of 2 statistical models developed for predicting international swimming performances was evaluated. The first model employed linear regression and forecasting to examine performance trends among medal winners, finalists, and semifinalists over an 8-year period. A machine-learning algorithm was used to generate time predictions for each individual event for the Paris 2024 Olympic Games. The second model was a Bayesian framework and comprised an autoregressive term (the previous winning time), moving average (past 3 events), and covariates for stroke, gender, distance, and type of event (World Championships vs Olympic Games). To examine the accuracy of the predictions from both models, the mean absolute error was determined between the predicted times for the Budapest 2022 World Championships and the actual results from said championships. Results: The mean absolute error for prediction of swimming performances was 0.80% for the linear-regression machine-learning model and 0.85% for the Bayesian model. The predicted times and actual times from the Budapest 2022 World Championships were highly correlated (r = .99 for both approaches). Conclusions: These models, and associated predictions for swimming events at the Paris 2024 Olympic Games, provide an evidence-based performance framework for coaches, sport-science support staff, and athletes to develop and evaluate training plans, strategies, and tactics, as well as informing resource allocation to athletes, based on their potential for the Paris 2024 Olympic Games. © 2023 Human Kinetics, Inc.",10.1123/ijspp.2023-0174,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85172884699&doi=10.1123%2fijspp.2023-0174&partnerID=40&md5=e9738342e19be88a1029bef3661daf60,SCOPUS,No,A los tiempos de natación no se puede apostar.

Miguel,Enhanced Visible-Light Photocatalytic Activity and Mechanism of Ag@AgCl-Decorated TiO2 Nanotubes,"This paper describes the excellent photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical performance of Ag@AgCl/TiO2 nanotubes (Ag@AgCl/TNTs) that were successfully prepared by a simple multistep reaction route. Using AgNO3 as Ag source and HCl as Cl source, AgCl was loaded onto synthetic TNTs by a coprecipitation method, and some of the Ag+ on the nanotubes was reduced to Ag0 by a photoreduction method. The crystal structure, morphology, and properties of the materials were characterized by x-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) measurements, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), ultraviolet–visible (UV–Vis) spectrophotometry, and photoluminescence (PL) techniques. The effects of using different ratios of Ag@AgCl on the photocatalytic performance of the composites were investigated via degradation of o-nitrobenzoic acid (o-NBA). The results showed that the optimum doping ratio of Ag@AgCl was 40%, and the removal rate of o-NBA by 40%Ag@AgCl/TNTs (40%AC/T) was 3.68 and 5.76 times higher compared with TNTs under visible light, respectively. When Ag@AgCl was loaded on TiO2 nanotubes, the mechanism of activity enhancement of the prepared material can be regarded as the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect of Ag0, which enhanced the response of the material to visible light, effectively achieving separation of photogenerated electrons and holes. © 2020, The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society.",10.1007/s11664-020-08552-6,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85094683395&doi=10.1007%2fs11664-020-08552-6&partnerID=40&md5=9c1adc4d9bf6f4d2c96d28033d3c0ae7,SCOPUS,No,Está centrado en la química,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Miguel,Team performance indicators which differentiate between winning and losing in elite Gaelic football,"The objective of this study was to identify performance indicators which differentiated between winning and losing elite Gaelic football teams. Eighty three technical and tactical performance variables were measured in 13 teams during 26 league and championship games throughout 2014–2015. Univariate analysis of full-games revealed that winners achieved a significantly higher total score, number of scores, shots, points, points from play and goals, resulting in superior shot efficiency, average attack per score, and scores per 10 possessions. Winners gained significantly more turnovers and completed significantly less unsuccessful hand passes. Winners also performed significantly less kick outs, resulting in fewer successful kick outs and successful dead ball kick passes overall. A principal component analysis, conducted on 18 variables produced 4 components, which explained 81.9% of the variance. Both logistic regression (8.00, χ2(1) = 16.00, p < 0.001) and discriminant analysis (Ʌ = 0.53, χ2(1) = 13.77, p < 0.001) revealed that one component, defensive counterattacking, significantly contributed to outcome and differentiated winners from losers with a cross-validation accuracy of 87.5%. Coaches can use this information to organise their defensive system to generate opposition turnovers and also incorporate sufficient flexibility to facilitate effective transitions to exploit their own offensive counterattacking opportunities. © 2019, © 2019 Cardiff Metropolitan University.",10.1080/24748668.2019.1621674,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85069714200&doi=10.1080%2f24748668.2019.1621674&partnerID=40&md5=ae36db9f24ee7f75b60569a93223fa77,SCOPUS,,Gaelic football no es un deporte al que se pueda apostar en España.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Sports betting around the world: A systematic review,"Background and aims: This systematic review examines whether sports betting behaviors differ among and between sports bettors in different countries, evaluates psychosocial problems related to sports betting behaviors and how problems may vary by country, and lastly, summarizes the current regulatory guidelines for sports betting. Methods: We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines and included peer-reviewed articles from PubMed, Web of Science, and PsycINFO. Studies on sports betting behavior were included if they were published in English or Chinese between January 1, 2010 and March 28th, 2022. We gathered regulatory information from peer-reviewed articles, legal acts, and relevant websites. Of 2,450 articles screened, 65 were included in the final review. Results: Marketing and promotion of sports betting were more prominent for sports betting in Australia and the United Kingdom. Interviews with sports bettors demonstrated that sports betting is persuasive and normalized. Psychosocial problems do not appear to differ greatly by country, and sports betting appears to be associated with elevated levels of problem gambling. Responsible gambling approaches have helped address risky sports betting behaviors. China and South Korea have imposed more strict regulations and restrictions on sports betting access in comparison to countries such as Australia or the United States. Discussion and conclusions: Currently, sports betting is easy to access, normalized, and contains many attractive features for sports bettors.

,Prediction of football match results with Machine Learning,"Football is one of the most popular sports in the world, so the perception of the game and the prediction of results is of general interest to fans, coaches, media and gamblers. Although predicting football results is a very complex task, the football betting business has grown over time. The unpredictability of football results and the growing betting business justify the development of prediction models to support gamblers. In this article, we develop machine learning methods that take multiple statistics of previous matches and attributes of players from both teams as inputs to predict the outcome of football matches. Several prediction models were tested, with the experimental results showing encouraging performance in terms of the profit margin of football bets. © 2022 Elsevier B.V..

Miguel,A Prospective Analysis of Competitive Balance Levels in Major League Soccer,"This study introduces a graphical methodology to the analysis of competitive balance in sports, which is prospective in nature and captures more subtleties than commonly-used retrospective measures. Thus, this study examines the evolution of competitive balance in Major League Soccer from 2004 to 2015, including the potential role played by certain league policies. For this purpose, we use prospective measures, based on probabilities that are extracted from betting odds (ex-ante) and on retrospective indicators (ex-post). The results differ slightly when analyzing competitive balance and predicting attendance. However, the graphical measures provide additional practical information about the characteristics of competitive balance. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",10.1007/s11151-018-9667-3,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054801654&doi=10.1007%2fs11151-018-9667-3&partnerID=40&md5=2f23b228c853283176f0cec97168d11c,SCOPUS,No,"Estudia evoluciones en el deporte, no se centra en un equipo o en algo a lo que se pueda apostar.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Predicting the outcomes of tennis matches using a low-level point model,"Quantitative analysis in tennis has become more important in recent years with the introduction of online betting exchanges. In this paper, the probability of winning a match in tennis is derived hierarchicallystarting from the probability of each player winning a point on their serve. Under the assumption that each point is identically and independently distributed, the probability of each player winning a pointwhen serving and when returning serve is derived using player statistics. These probabilities can be used to calculate probabilities of winning a game, a set and consequently the match from any point in a livegame.

Miguel,"Techniques utilised at 2017 Judo World Championship and their classification: Comparisons between sexes, weight categories, winners and non-winners","                             Background. Judo throwing techniques are traditionally classified as ashi-waza (leg techniques), te-waza (arm techniques), koshiwaza (hip techniques) and sutemi-waza (sacrifice techniques). However, this classification has recently been criticised, and instead a 9-group classification system based on action characteristics (movement type, base of support, throw direction, and position of attack) has been proposed. Problem and aim. To determine the throwing techniques that resulted in score using this classification and compare weight categories, sexes and medal/non-medal winners during the 2017 Senior Judo World Championship. Method. The analysis included 756 throwing techniques that resulted in a score (over 601 matches) across the competition. Results. There was an association between technique classification and sex (c                             2                              = 15.64; p = 0.048; Cramer's V = 0.144): females scored more frequently using the techniques from group 3 compared with males (c                             2                              = 6.93; p = 0.009), whereas males scored more often using the techniques from group 8 compared with females (c                             2                              = 5.55; p = 0.019). A significant relationship between technique classification and weight category (c                             2                              = 106.19; p < 0.001; Cramer's V = 0.153) was observed, but there was no association between technique classification and World Championship classification (c                             2                              = 9.55; p = 0.298; Cramer's V = 0.112). Additionally, a limited number of throwing techniques resulted in more than half of all scoring situations during this competition. Conclusions. Techniques types utilised by athletes differed according to sex and weight category, and that a few number of techniques were utilised in this top-level judo competition.                          © 2019, Idokan Poland Association.;                              Tło.

,Using machine learning and candlestick patterns to predict the outcomes of American football games,"Match outcome prediction is a challenging problem that has led to the recent rise in machine learning being adopted and receiving significant interest from researchers in data science and sports. This study explores predictability in match outcomes using machine learning and candlestick charts, which have been used for stock market technical analysis. We compile candlestick charts based on betting market data and consider the character of the candlestick charts as features in our predictive model rather than the performance indicators used in the technical and tactical analysis in most studies. The predictions are investigated as two types of problems, namely, the classification of wins and losses and the regression of the winning/losing margin. Both are examined using various methods of machine learning, such as ensemble learning, support vector machines and neural networks. The effectiveness of our proposed approach is evaluated with a dataset of 13261 instances over 32 seasons in the National Football League. The results reveal that the random subspace method for regression achieves the best accuracy rate of 68.4%. The candlestick charts of betting market data can enable promising results of match outcome prediction based on pattern recognition by machine learning, without limitations regarding the specific knowledge required for various kinds of sports. © 2020 by the authors.

Miguel,Home advantage and mispricing in indoor sports’ ghost games: the case of European basketball,"Several recent studies suggest that the home advantage, that is, the benefit competitors accrue from performing in familiar surroundings, was—at least temporarily—reduced in games played without spectators due to the COVID-19 Pandemic. These games played without fans during the Pandemic have been dubbed ‘ghost games’. However, the majority of the research to date focus on soccer and no contributions have been provided for indoor sports, where the effect of the support of the fans might have a stronger impact than in outdoor arenas. In this paper, we try to fill this gap by investigating the effect of ghost games in basketball with a special focus on the possible reduction of the home advantage due to the absence of spectators inside the arena. In particular, we test (i) for the reduction of the home advantage in basketball, (ii) whether such reduction tends to disappear over time, (iii) if the bookmakers promptly adapt to such structural change or whether mispricing was created on the betting market. The results from a large data set covering all seasons since 2004 for the ten most popular and followed basketball leagues in Europe show, on the one hand, an overall significant reduction of the home advantage of around 5% and no evidence that suggests that this effect has been reduced at as teams became more accustomed to playing without fans; on the other hand, bookmakers appear to have anticipated such effect and priced home win in basketball matches accordingly, thus avoiding creating mispricing on betting markets. © 2022, The Author(s).",10.1007/s10479-022-04950-7,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85139162526&doi=10.1007%2fs10479-022-04950-7&partnerID=40&md5=485470d7fbb7d36fd5697842191d195c,SCOPUS,No,Se hace un análisis del impacto que tiene jugar en casa a la hora de afrontar una eliminatoria.

Miguel,Statistical Review and Match Analysis of Rugby World Cups Finals,"The aim of this study was to describe the game related statistics and match analysis of rugby world cups finals from 1987 to 2015. Video recordings of all (n = 8 matches) rugby world cup finals were used for the purpose of this study. Games were analysed using the video analysis software (Sports code V8.9, Sportstec, Australia) and supplementary data were collected from the official reports published by the International Rugby Board and from webpages of Rugby World Cups. Magnitude of differences between the winners and losers was assessed mechanistically. Only 5 tries in total were scored in the last 8 rugby world cup finals. The main two modes of scoring points were penalty kicks and drop goals. Winning teams attempted more penalty kicks, yet seemed to miss more. The number of drop goals was similar between winning and losing teams. These findings highlight the significance of having an on form place-kicker and from a defensive perspective, conceding fewer penalties in kickable positions. Winners of the Rugby World Cup final won more scrums and lost few line-outs, emphasising the importance of winning the set-pieces.

Miguel,Detection and object position measurement using computer vision on humanoid soccer,"Bandung State Polytechnic (POLBAN) has participated twice in humanoid robot soccer competition. From those two participations, it was known that the weakness was in computer vision. Computer vision capability is constrained by robot hardware specifications so that it was impossible to embed our recent object recognition application. In this study, we propose a computer vision system that implemented the latest technology similar to that technology used in the humanoid soccer winner season 2011. The model uses a field where the object and size comply with the rules of humanoid soccer tournament 2011. Some previous methods use off the field camera which is cannot be used in humanoid soccer tournament because the sensor used has to be attached to the robot. While the approach in this paper emphasized to the fact that goalkeeper's position tend to be static relative to the object in a competition field. Goal keeper through its vision system recognizes objects and measures ball position using image processing technique. The process of ball position measurement was first carried out by recognizing three different objects in the competition field: ball, goal's bar, and field line. Recognition process utilizes back projection method based on HSV information. After the three objects were detected, the measurement of ball position on the field was carried out by ANN model by considering ball position in the image, position of goal's horizontal bar, and the middle field line point. After 10,000 training, the result is encouraging with the average error is less than 1 cm.",10.1109/ICITEED.2013.6676217,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6676217,IEEE,No,Se centra en la programación de los robots a la hora de jugar al fútbol.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Miguel,Do fans’ emotions influence charitable donations? Evidence from monetary and returnable cup donations in German soccer stadiums,"I study the influence of league match results of two German soccer clubs on their fans’ prosocial behavior in the stadium. For this purpose, a unique donation scheme is analyzed that collects charitable donations in the form of returnable cups with volunteers’ help (in addition to monetary donations). Using time-series analyses for matches from 2010 to 2020, the results suggest that home fans are willing to donate more to charity due to their club's positive match results (victories). The results also indicate that reference-dependent preferences play a role in home fans’ willingness to donate. First, victories following a halftime draw lead to increased returnable cup donations. Second, the positive effects of wins are more likely to be explained by expected wins taking into account the team's quality or the betting odds as reference points. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.",10.1016/j.socec.2021.101807,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85121013393&doi=10.1016%2fj.socec.2021.101807&partnerID=40&md5=05e903660e3b6719f5b899e6d2e3fe72,SCOPUS,No,"Habla de donaciones y comportamiento humano, no de apuestas.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Miguel,Gambling Advertising and Incidental Marketing Exposure in Soccer Matchday Programmes: A Longitudinal Study,"Gambling is marketed in English soccer across various formats such as TV advertising, social media, pitch side hoardings, and shirt sponsorship. There have been recent reductions in TV advertising brought about by self-regulation, but gambling shirt sponsorship remains frequent, and can lead to a high frequency of incidental marketing exposure on TV. Knowledge is lacking on how gambling advertising frequency and marketing exposure have changed over time in other media, such as in matchday programmes. This study addressed this gap via a content analysis of programmes for 44 teams across 3 periods spanning 18 months (N=132). The number of gambling adverts decreased from 2.3 to 1.3 per-programme, while incidental exposure prevalence stayed constant, at a higher rate of 42.7 incidences per-programme. Teams sponsored by gambling companies had more adverts per-programme than those sponsored by other industries (2.3 versus 1.2), and also had more incidental exposure (58.8 versus 20.2). Incidental exposure to gambling marketing was consistently more prevalent (42.7) per-programme than alcohol (3.2) or safer gambling messages (3.1). Furthermore, across all timepoints, 56.8% of dedicated children’s sections contained incidences of gambling marketing. Researchers and policymakers should consider that sports fans can get exposed to gambling marketing through a number of channels outside of TV advertising. Indirect and incidental exposure to gambling marketing remains high, which can be particularly challenging for those experiencing gambling related harm. All forms of gambling marketing must be considered when making legislative changes. © 2022 The author(s).",10.29173/cgs116,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85137029833&doi=10.29173%2fcgs116&partnerID=40&md5=f531347a12b7400c3023d1c2e7e5aac3,SCOPUS,No,Habla sobre publicidad en las apuestas,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Miguel,Decoding the decade: Analyzing the evolution of technical and tactical performance in elite padel tennis (2011–2021),"Despite the recent popularity of padel tennis and extensive scientific research on technical and tactical performance, anthropometric, biomechanical, and physiological characteristics, there is still a lack of long-term retrospective investigation. Therefore, this study aimed to analyze key performance indicators (KPIs) to provide the changes in these indicators over a decade spanning from 2011 to 2021. The sample included 45 (i.e. 100 sets; 957 games; 5743 points; and 54,918 shots) professional men's matches (Padel Pro Tour and World Padel Tour finals and semifinals) from three different sports seasons (2011, 2016, and 2021). KPIs related to time motion and technical and tactical analysis (i.e. unforced errors and winner shots) were examined. A series of linear mixed models was performed to investigate difference among competition years (2011, 2016, and 2021). Comparing the evolution of the game across the observed decade, it emerged a more progressive intense game (more explosive and rapid playing actions), decreasing number of shots per point (8.8 vs 9.5), and an increasing number of shots per minute (44.2 vs 40.0). Further, an increase in the importance of efficiency in overhead shots (unforced errors from bandeja/vibora +116% from 2011 to 2016) and responding to serve shots (unforced errors from serve return +17% from 2011 to 2021) emerged. Therefore, the present findings are able to highlight the evolution playing of professional padel (i.e. fewer shots per point, shorter effective playing time, decreased average point durations, higher number of shots per minute), thus providing references to potential valuable training plans. © The Author(s) 2024.",10.1177/17479541241228059,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85184159731&doi=10.1177%2f17479541241228059&partnerID=40&md5=6266f8c3c37c797f6a019a0ecbb326fb,SCOPUS,No,"Análisis de la evolución de una técnica, no es relevante en los modelos de apuestas deportivas.

The general goal of the study was to investigate the relationship between agility t-test (change of direction speed ability, CODS), 20-m sprint test (S20m) (linear speed ability), and countermovement jump (CMJ) test (lower limb explosive power ability). Methods. The sample involved 18 elite female football athletes (age: 18.56 ± 2.24 years, height: 169.47 ± 6.48 cm, weight: 63.52 ± 6.85 kg). Pearson correlation coefficients were applied. Multiple linear regression served to explain the relationship between the dependent variable (CODS) and 2 independent variables (S20m and CMJ). Results. Pearson correlation analysis indicated a moderate relationship between CMJ and CODS performance (r = -0.59, p = 0.01) and a very strong significant relationship between S20m and CODS performance (r = 0.80, p = 0.00). The results of multiple linear regression proved that both independent variables (S20m and CMJ) explained about 60.0% (adjusted R2) of the total model variance in relation to the dependent variable (CODS), whereas only S20m significantly (p < 0.05) explained CODS ability. Conclusions. The study highlighted the impact of explosive power of lower limbs (CMJ) and linear speed capability (S20m) on agility performance (CODS) in our sample. It suggests that the results of agility, linear sprint, and jumping performance seem to have similar determining factors. It is worthwhile to consider these findings in the training process of female elite football players in order to focus on essential training elements of physical fitness. © 2020 University School of Physical Education in Wroclaw.",10.5114/hm.2020.91281,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85080099572&doi=10.5114%2fhm.2020.91281&partnerID=40&md5=1539bf5fdd329fd883c12c69628fadce,SCOPUS,No,"Se centra en el análisis individual de jugadores, eso no determina sus acciones como marcar más goles en un partido, ni define el resultado del mismo, por tanto, no se puede utilizar para apostar",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"Information, prices and efficiency in an online betting market","We contribute to the discussion on betting market efficiency by studying the odds (or prices) set by fifty-one online bookmakers, for the result outcomes in over 16,000 association football matches in England since 2010. Adapting a methodology typically used to evaluate forecast efficiency, we test the Efficient Market Hypothesis in this context.

Miguel,A machine learning perspective on responsible gambling,"Gamblers are frequently reminded to 'gamble responsibly'. But these qualitative reminders come with no quantitative information for gamblers to judge relative product risk in skill-based gambling forms. By comparison, consumers purchasing alcohol are informed of product strength by alcohol by volume percentage (ABV%) or similar labels. This paper uses mixed logistic regression machine learning to uncover the potential variation in soccer betting outcomes. This paper uses data from four bet types and eight seasons of English Premier League soccer, ending in 2018. Outcomes across each bet type were compared using three betting strategies: the most-skilled prediction, a random strategy and the least-skilled prediction. There was a large spread in betting outcomes, with, for example, the per-bet average loss varying by a factor of 54 (from 1.1% to 58.9%). Gamblers' losses were positively correlated with the observable betting odds across all bets, indicating that betting odds are one salient feature that could be used to inform gamblers about product risk. Such large differences in product risk are relevant to the promotion of responsible gambling.

Miguel,How to Enjoy Watching One-Sided Sport Games,"While sports games in which both competitors have an equal chance to win are preferred by audiences, it is often easy to predict the winners in tennis matches. On the other hand, some audiences are interested in the players' athletic quality as well as which player will win. Whether an individual focuses on primary attributes such as the winner or secondary attributes such as the performance depends on the construal level. Thus we tested whether manipulating construal level can make audiences interested in a one-sided tennis match. We conducted an experiment with participants to evaluate excitement at watching videos of tennis matches just after their construal levels were controlled. The results show that there is a significant interaction between construal level and predictability of the winner, implying that the control had an effect on excitement for at least one video.

,A profitable model for predicting the over/under market in football,"The over/under 2.5 goals betting market allows gamblers to bet on whether the total number of goals in a football match will exceed 2.5. In this paper, a set of ratings, named ‘Generalised Attacking Performance’ (GAP) ratings, are defined which measure the attacking and defensive performance of each team in a league. GAP ratings are used to forecast matches in ten European football leagues and their profitability is tested in the over/under market using two value betting strategies. GAP ratings with match statistics such as shots and shots on target as inputs are shown to yield better predictive value than the number of goals. An average profit of around 0.8 percent per bet taken is demonstrated over twelve years when using only shots and corners (and not goals) as inputs.

Miguel,EFFECTS OF MATCH FORMS AND OUTCOMES ON THE PHASE-BASED ELITE MALE TABLE TENNIS MATCH PERFORMANCE,"The aim of the study was to explore the service round technical-tactical performance indicators of three phases discriminating the match result and the two match forms. The statistics of 72 professional men’s singles matches of the 2018 international competitions were collected. A chi-square test was used to assess the relationship between match form, match outcome and service round result. Afterwards, a two-way ANOVA was performed to evaluate the effect of match form (SHM: match between players of the same handedness and OHM: match between players of the opposite handedness) and match result on three evaluation indices of thirteen technical-tactical indicators. The results displayed that: (1) there was a weak relationship between the service round outcome and match form for both the winning and losing players (p<0.001, ES=0.12); (2) the winners outperformed the defeated players by a higher technical effectiveness in all three phases with small to moderate effects (p<0.05, ES:0.50-1.00) at both match forms; (3) the usage rate of performance indicators of the first four strokes phase and six strokes above phase distinguished the SHM matches from the OHM matches by small to large effects (p<0.05, ES:0.50-1.26).

,Feature Selection to Win the Point of ATP Tennis Players Using Rally Information,"In tennis, the accumulation of data has progressed and research on tactical analysis has been conducted. Estimating strategically important factors would have the benefit of providing players with useful advice and helping audience members understand what tennis players are good at. Previous research has been conducted into ways of predicting Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) tennis match outcomes as well as estimating factors that are important for victories using machine learning models. The challenge of previous research is that the victory factor lacks concreteness. Since we thought the root of the abovementioned problem was that previous researchers used game summary as a feature and did not consider the process of rallies between points, this research focused on calculating the frequency of single shots, two-shot patterns, and specific effective shot patterns from each point rally of ATP singles matches. We then used those data to predict point winners and useful features using L1-regularized logistic regression. The highest accuracy obtained was 66.5%, and the area under the curve (AUC) was 0.689. The most prominent feature we found was the ratio of specific shots by specific players.

However, it is considered that overcoming challenges at an early age is connected with success in later years. Therefore, the aim of this qualitative study was to research the various negative life events (injuries, lack of financial resources, failure to be selected for the national team) of various tennis players and the way in which these events influenced their tennis career. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with three categories of male tennis players (N = 30), these being: (1) Grand Slam winners, (2) players ranked between position 150 and 300 on the professional men’s tennis rankings, and (3) players ranked between position 500 and 1500 on the professional men’s tennis rankings. Data analysis was implemented by using reflexive thematic analysis. Three topics were generated that included: injuries and the way they dealt with them, financial resources and how this affected their sports development, and failure to be selected for their national team. The obtained results indicate that the differences between the different level of success among tennis players refer more to the overcoming of various negative life events (injuries, lack of financial resources, failure to be selected for the national team) that the players faced during their tennis careers. © 2023, Croatian Anthropological Society.

,Importance of disguising groundstrokes in a match between two top tennis players (Federer and Djokovic),"At the elite level in tennis, players tend to “disguise” their stroke intentions, confuse the receiver's judgment, and interfere with their anticipatory response. How frequent and effective disguised strokes are used remains unclear. We tried to answer these questions by analysing performance differences in the two consecutive sets of the match in the 2019 Wimbledon final, played by two tennis greats. Our hypothesis was that by effectively disguising their stroke intention, the hitters in this match could establish tactical superiority. By utilizing frame by frame video analysis, we determined whether each groundstroke was done with disguised intention or not. A disguised stroke was defined as the stroke, whose Initial Stroke Intention (ISI) of the ball direction in the pre-contact phase differed from the actual post-contact trajectory. To judge the ISI, we analysed the hitters’ cues during the pre-contact period, court movement before the loading phase (contextual observation), and body posture during the set-up phase (preparing the body for force generation). To investigate the effectiveness of disguised strokes, we evaluated the receiver's anticipatory movement as well as subsequent point dynamics. Our results show that both players, as hitters, created advantageous point dynamics (APD) (winners or advantage) while as receivers made incorrect anticipatory responses significantly more frequently to the disguised strokes than that of the undisguised strokes. As hypothesized, disguised strokes in the match between two tennis experts can be not only highly unpredictable but also efficient in creating a tactical advantage for the hitter and a disadvantage for the receiver. © The Author(s) 2022.",10.1177/17479541221075728,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85129128946&doi=10.1177%2f17479541221075728&partnerID=40&md5=fad842459142fd37bb8cd753b4bb9b36,SCOPUS,Si,,p-valor,Analisis Estadistico,Tenis,,masculino,No,Análisis golpe a golpe de la dirección de la cabeza y la dirección del golpe y el moviento del oponente a un lado o a otro,299 golpes,Imágenes en vídeo de 299 puntos,público,,"Predecir con una imagen, analizando la dirección de la cabeza y el moviento del rival, la dirección de un punto",Performance Statistics,"Se consigue un p-valor de 0.016, consiguiéndose obtener una relación entre los golpes engañosos y la victoria del punto",,,,"Da un nuevo enfoque, una nueva característica más que puede ser utilizada para categorizar jugadores y tener más información a la hora de realizar una apuesta",No se puede utilizar en las apuestas ya que es imposible analizar la imagen y tener tiempo para apostar al resultado.
,Predictive modeling of tennis matches: a review,"Predicting the outcome of sporting events has always been a popular area of interest for sports professionals as well as the general public. Although domain experts have traditionally been the main contributors for generating sports predictions, relying solely on human expertise and intuition is not a scalable, time-effective, nor a cost-effective solution. Hence, computers are taking the leading role in predicting the outcomes of sporting events, in terms of estimating the final score or guessing the winner, but also for predicting the occurrence of various events that may happen during the game. Predictive analytics has been effectively applied to a wide range of sports, including popular team sports as well as individual sports. The nature of sport plays a significant role in the adaptation of different predictive techniques based on diverse statistical and mathematical models. Tennis has a strongly defined structure and a rigid scoring system which, along with the sport’s popularity and large and easily accessible datasets, makes tennis match modeling a hot topic in scientific literature.

,A new model for predicting the winner in tennis based on the eigenvector centrality,"The use of statistical tools for predicting the winner in tennis matches has enjoyed an increase in popularity over the last two decades and, currently, a variety of methods are available. In particular, paired comparison approaches make use of latent ability estimates or rating calculations to determine the probability that a player will win a match. In this paper, we extend this latter class of models by using network indicators for the predictions. We propose a measure based on eigenvector centrality. Unlike what happens for the standard paired comparisons class (where the rates or latent abilities only change at time t for those players involved in the matches at time t), the use of a centrality measure allows the ratings of the whole set of players to vary every time there is a new match. The resulting ratings are then used as a covariate in a simple logit model. Evaluating the proposed approach with respect to some popular competing specifications, we find that the centrality-based approach largely and consistently outperforms all the alternative models considered in terms of the prediction accuracy. Finally, the proposed method also achieves positive betting results. © 2022, The Author(s).",10.1007/s10479-022-04594-7,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85125698437&doi=10.1007%2fs10479-022-04594-7&partnerID=40&md5=bb7044e60e47760428f05f66439101fc,SCOPUS,Si,,Brier Score,"Elo, Red Neuronal",Tenis,,"masculino, femenino",Sí,Transformar B-scores en probabilidades,14170 partidos de chicos y 15181 partidos de chicas," The information includedare the match scores of all the most important tennis tournaments, the (closing) betting oddsof different professional bookmakers, and the ofﬁcial rankings and the points for each playerat the time of the match.",público,www.tennis-data.co.uk,El objetivo del estudio es desarrollar un nuevo método basado en redes para evaluar la habilidad de los jugadores de tenis y mejorar la predicción de los resultados de los partidos. ,,El resultado principal obtenido en el estudio es que el modelo basado en B-score supera a los métodos tradicionales en la predicción de resultados de partidos de tenis y en la obtención de mejores retornos en apuestas.,,"2016/17, 2017/18, 2018/19, 2019/20",,"Este artículo presenta un nuevo método basado en redes para evaluar la habilidad y clasificación de jugadores de tenis, denominado B-score, el cual aprovecha la centralidad de Bonacich para calcular los ratings de los jugadores.

We introduced an innovative approach to quantify and combine strategic and psychological momentum using the entropy weight method and analytic hierarchy process, and tested its effectiveness. Utilizing data from the Wimbledon Championship 2023, we constructed a support vector machine model to predict the turning point and winner of each point, and optimized it using particle swarm optimization. Our model achieved a significant level of accuracy (96.09% for turning point and 83.52% for predicting the winner) and performed well in different courts and players. Furthermore, we compared its performance with commonly utilized predictive models, including ARIMA, LSTM and BP networks, and found that our model exhibited higher accuracy than other existing models in predicting the point winner.

Miguel,Competitive evolution of professional wheelchair tennis from the paralympic games in Athens 2004 to rio 2016: An observational study,"The aim of this study was to analyse and compare the activity pattern and technical-tactical parameters of men’s wheelchair tennis matches from the Paralympic Games (PG) in Athens 2004 (A), Beijing 2008 (B), London 2012 (L) and Rio 2016 (R). A total of 5702 shots from twelve final round matches were analysed. Activity patterns (e.g., rally duration, shots per rally…) and technical effectivity (e.g., errors, winners…) were recorded. An ANOVA test with post hoc pairwise comparisons was conducted to compare the mean differences among matches of different PG. Game duration, points and shots per game differed according to the PG (R and L > B and A). Rally duration (p < 0.001) and shots per rally (p < 0.001) were longer at R and L than B and A. The effectivity of the last shots was different, the errors have been increasing and the winners have been decreasing. The main finding indicates that activity patterns and technical parameters have evolved mainly between A and B to L and R.

,A calibration method with dynamic updates for within-match forecasting of wins in tennis,"In-match predictions of player win probabilities for professional tennis matches have a wide range of potential applications, including betting, fan engagement, and performance evaluation. The ideal properties of an in-play prediction method include the ability to incorporate both useful pre-match information and relevant in-match information as the match progresses, in order to update the pre-match expectations. This paper presents an in-play forecasting method that achieves both of these goals by combining a pre-match calibration method with a dynamic empirical Bayes updating rule. We present an optimisation rule for guiding the specifications of the dynamic updates using a large sample of professional tennis matches. We apply the results to data from the 2017 season and show that the dynamic model provides a 28% reduction in the error of in-match serve predictions and improves the win prediction accuracy by four percentage points relative to a constant ability model. The method is applied to two Australian Open men's matches, and we derive several corollary statistics to highlight key dynamics in the win probabilities during a match. © 2017 International Institute of Forecasters",10.1016/j.ijforecast.2017.11.008,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85039992372&doi=10.1016%2fj.ijforecast.2017.11.008&partnerID=40&md5=80338e0275fd4bd492cc5dc3f16abf12,SCOPUS,Si,,RMSE,"Bayes, Elo, Analisis Estadistico",Tenis,,"femenino, masculino",Sí,Calculo de atributos basados en estadísticas,24.884 partidos masculínos y 20.716 partidos femeninos,"Características de los partidos, de los jugadores y valores de apuestas pre partidos",público,http://www.tennis-abstract.com/,"El objetivo principal del estudio es desarrollar un método de pronóstico que combine información previa al partido con actualizaciones dinámicas durante el mismo, mejorando así la precisión de las predicciones de victoria en tiempo real.",Victoria o Derrota,El modelo propuesto demostró una reducción del 28% en el error de las predicciones de servicio durante el partido y mejoró la precisión de las predicciones de victoria en cuatro puntos porcentuales en comparación con un modelo de habilidad constante.,,2010/11 - 2017/18,,"Mejora los resultados de modelos anteriores y además incorpora información en tiempo real, lo que es algo extremadamente valioso a la hora de maximizar ganancias",No se detalla/entiende los métodos usados exactamente
Miguel,Professional padel tennis: Characteristics and effectiveness of the shots played to the fence,"Padel tennis is played on different surfaces and the padel tennis court is made of different materials. This influences how the ball can be played back after it hits or bounces on them. The aim of this study was to analyse the characteristics of shots played to the fence in professional padel tennis. A total of 489 shots to the fence played by the 8 best pairs (16 male and 16 female players) competing in an international professional tournament were recorded. Using an observational methodology, variables such as the distance of the shot to the net, the side of the court from which the shot was played, the trajectory of the shot and the type of shot were analysed and compared according to gender and effectiveness. The results showed that in women's padel, the overhead shot was significantly more used to play the ball to the fence (48.4%) as compared to men's padel (39.9%), where volleys were significantly more used (39.5%) as compared to women's padel (30.5%). Crosscourt shots were significantly more effective (24.2%) than the down the line ones (16.8%). Groundstrokes were the strokes which produced significantly higher number of winners (25.2%) as well as errors (31.1%). As the distance to the net increased, the effectiveness of the shot played to the fence significantly decreased.

,Validating and identifying KPIs in ATP/WTA hard court tennis match play (2019–2023) using the PWOL method,"The study provided further validity for the use of the PWOL (percentage of matches which the winner outscored the loser) method within elite hard-court tennis. Over half of the ATP/WTA competitive calendar (January-March and August-November) is played on hard courts so is an important progression. Data from 810 men's and 586 women's hard-court matches across Grand Slams and ATP/WTA World Tours (i.e. Masters, 500s and 250s) between 2019 and 2023 was used for analysis. PWOL was validated alongside two traditionally used statistical methods (paired t-test, point-biserial correlation). Very high agreement between all approaches was shown using Spearman's correlation analysis for both men and women (>0.97). The study further identified the indicators most related to winning performance, identifying baseline points won, first serve points won, points won of 0-4 rally length and Winners:UE Ratio to be most strongly associated with success, whilst forced errors were most associated with losing. Ball three indicators lacked association with match outcome, suggesting any major focus training ‘one-two punches’ on serve should be approached with caution. PWOL has proven to be a valid method for assessing success in elite hard-court tennis (offering potential for wider sports application) to ultimately aid coach decision-making. © The Author(s) 2024.",10.1177/17479541241235595,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85186619259&doi=10.1177%2f17479541241235595&partnerID=40&md5=0b5d6747dfd5abb9419c08d104c2e345,SCOPUS,Si,,"Likelihood Ratio Test, pwol",Analisis Estadistico,Tenis,,"femenino, masculino",Sí,"Se recopilaron datos detallados de los partidos, incluyendo estadísticas de rendimiento de los jugadores y resultados de puntos y juegos",810 partidos masculinos y 586 femeninos,"Puntos ganados desde la línea de fondo.​

Miguel,The Impact of Sleep-Wake Behaviour on Tennis Match Performance in Junior State Grade Tennis Players,"Purpose: To date, no study has investigated the extent to which sleep-wake behaviour (SWB) influences match performance in junior tennis players. This study aimed to assess the influence of SWB for the week and night before on match performance, particularly match analytics and activity. Methods: This study recruited 10 junior state grade tennis players who wore an actigraphy device and completed a sleep diary for the week before their match on two separate occasions throughout their competition season. Players wore a global positioning system device to track their movement during matches, and an experienced tennis coach recorded players' match analytics. Results: This study showed that the sleep fragmentation index was significantly lower the week before matches in females who had won than those who had lost. Additionally, the sleep fragmentation index was significantly lower the night before a given match than the week before. Only sleep fragmentation index and sleep latency significantly influenced match performance in junior tennis players. The percentage of second serves points won differed between match wins and losses for male players, while winners and forced errors differed for female players. Conclusion: These findings provide a detailed profile of tennis match play in junior state grade players. Despite individual differences, reduced restlessness the night before a match coincides with increased match performance. © 2022, The Author(s).",10.1007/s42978-022-00177-x,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85137857139&doi=10.1007%2fs42978-022-00177-x&partnerID=40&md5=3d4493828e0f7740cfcf42ee476a14ab,SCOPUS,No,"Característica que aunque tenga efecto en el resultado es imposible saber a la hora de realizar una apuesta, por tanto no es válido.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Miguel,A decision support system for the professional soccer referee in time-sensitive operations,"The growing popularity of soccer in terms of TV revenue and betting, as well as ubiquitous use of instant replay, has placed increased pressure on referee's to make accurate decisions. Although the speed and agility of the game and scrutiny of referee decisions (e.g. slow motion replay from multiple camera angles) has increased over time, the human decision-making ability of the referee has remained constant. For example, in the 2010 World Cup, 8% of the decision events were inaccurate. To maintain the integrity of the game, the accuracy must be improved significantly. Interviews conducted with Subject Matter Experts (SME) and an analysis of 17 English Premier League (EPL) games identified on average 627 decision events per game. Analysis of inaccurate calls identified excessive distance from the referee to the event, and referee blindspot as the two phenomena that resulted in inaccurate referee decisions. Three design alternatives were developed to address the distance and blindspot issues faced by the referee: vehicle propelled transportation (e.g. Segway), 2 official referees, and an overhead camera. Analysis of the performance of these design alternatives in 100 games, simulating ball movement and referee position, showed that the overhead camera relaying information to the official referee improves the referees decision accuracy of missed calls due to blind-spots by 20.26% and 11.31% over Segway and the two refereeing system, respectively.",10.1109/SIEDS.2011.5876851,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5876851,IEEE,No,Centrado en decisiones en las que no se puede apostar.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Clustering Winner Strokes in Professional Tennis Matches,"In tennis match, the variability in stroke routes and landing location depth limits the opponent’s tactics and leads to winner shots. This study was aimed to explore stroking patterns of winner final shots and the hitting technique preferences of elite players when achieving such strokes. The study acquired the spatial-temporal data of all winner shots (7,126) from the 2022 Australian Open male and female singles matches. Additionally, we used clustering, kernel density estimation, and radar charts for the comprehensive statistical analysis and visual representation of stroke routes and hitting techniques. The main findings show that: (1) The strategic use of forehand inside-out/in on the backhand side was more prevalent in professional male singles matches compared to female matches; (2) Four empirical target locations for winner final shots were identified, with two in the non-deep area and two in the deep area, all positioned close to the sidelines; (3) In addition to establish baseline dominance, male players also emphasize approach and net strokes. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024.",10.1007/978-981-97-2898-5_12,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85195965725&doi=10.1007%2f978-981-97-2898-5_12&partnerID=40&md5=01a4a7a9d71f52d95d5b12b00fd1491b,SCOPUS,Si,,Likelihood Ratio Test,Analisis Estadistico,Tenis,,"femenino, masculino",Sí,"Se recopilaron datos detallados de los partidos, incluyendo estadísticas de rendimiento de los jugadores y resultados de puntos y juegos",810 partidos masculinos y 586 femeninos,"Puntos ganados desde la línea de fondo.​

,Investigating the most important aspect of elite grass court tennis: Short points,"Research has shown that short points (points of 0–4 shots) are crucial in determining the outcome of elite men’s and women’s grass court tennis matches. However, research has not explored the importance of short points in more detail to inform practice design. This study aimed to establish the prevalence and importance of individual rally lengths within short points (i.e. points of 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4 shots) in terms of winning elite grass court tennis matches. Using the recently-validated PWOL (Percentage of matches in which the Winner Outscored the Loser) method, point-level data from 211 men’s and 209 women’s Wimbledon singles matches between 2015 and 2017 were analysed, with short points stratified into individual rally lengths. Results revealed that 1 shot (aces and missed serve-returns) was the most common rally length, with 0 shots (double faults) the least common. Points won of 1 shot, 2 shots and 4 shots were associated with winning matches and can therefore be considered important, but points won of 0 shots and 3 shots were not associated with match outcome. These results highlight the importance of serving and returning strategies at Wimbledon, and indicate that serves and serve-returns should be afforded focus during grass court training. However, the findings appear to contravene anecdotal assertions that ‘serve plus one’ strategies (points won of 3 shots) are crucial in elite tennis, as they did not differentiate winning and losing players; so coaches should consider the associated practice designs and amount of time afforded to such strategies. © The Author(s) 2021.",10.1177/1747954121999593,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85102025665&doi=10.1177%2f1747954121999593&partnerID=40&md5=61883915034b77671c09c98b626e2dcd,SCOPUS,Si,,pwol,Analisis Estadistico,Tenis,,"femenino, masculino",Sí,"Se recopilaron datos detallados de los partidos, incluyendo estadísticas de rendimiento de los jugadores y resultados de puntos y juegos",211 partidos masculinos y 209 femeninos en Wimbledo,"Puntos ganados en rallies de 0-4 golpes.​

,Differences in the Situational Parameters of Tennis Matches Between Winners and Losers in The Women’s Main Draw Competition At Roland Garros 2022,"Tennis is a world class competitive sport played under the rules of the International Tennis Federation. Also, tennis is characterized by repetitive actions of different types of strokes in match. The aim of this study was to determine if there are differences in the situational efficiency parameters between two groups of players (winners and losers) in the women’s main draw competition at Roland Garros 2022. This study included 125 main draw matches. Differences in performance were analysed across 7 situational efficiency variables: aces, double faults, 1st serve average speed, 2nd serve average speed, winners, unforced errors and forced errors. The results showed significant differences between winners and losers group of players with the following parameters on the winners’ side: winners (25.03/19.83; p < 0.0071) and unforced errors (22.80/29.06; p < 0.0071). The results demonstrated that there were no significant differences in double faults, 1st serve average speed, 2nd serve average speed, forced errors and aces. In addition to all the above, it is notable that more successful tennis players, as well as having more winners, record less unforced errors.

,Influence of relative Quality and experience in female single tennis match performance using cluster and discriminant analysis,"Due to the fast growth of advanced technology, the volume of sports data has increased, which has led to researchers' interest in studying the tennis data set. Tennis is an example of an individual sport where the opponent's skills and anticipation are just as significant as the player's personal qualities and abilities in determining the outcome of a match. Winning is greatly influenced by the experience as well as the comparative talent of the opponents. Hence, this study has two aims: first, to calculate the Relative Quality of each player and then classify the similar patterns of the female single players' performance based on their experience and Relative Quality, and second, to determine which weightings of the variables best discriminate between winners and losers for each cluster. The match statistics for four 2018 Grand Slam main-draw women's singles matches were collected from separate official tournament websites: the Australian Open, the French Open, Wimbledon, and the US Open, which consist of 1016 observations. The methods used in this study are hierarchical-based clustering analysis, which groups the players based on these two attributes, and discriminant analysis, which governs which attributes are best to discriminate among the winners and losers for each of the four clusters. Based on the cluster analysis results, four clusters were identified and designated as LEHRQ, LELRQ, HEHRQ, and HEHRQ. The outcome of the discriminant analysis shows that the performance of a tennis player is most likely reliant on holding their serve and remaining powerful to break their opponent's serve. Moreover, there are variations in the components among clusters. Identifying to which group a player belongs provides valuable assistance to both players and coaches in optimizing their training strategies and augmenting their performance by refining their serving and return abilities. © 2024 Author(s).",10.1063/5.0225405,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85203121656&doi=10.1063%2f5.0225405&partnerID=40&md5=6e57709b2b8e2f54e0cf453123a4ea9b,SCOPUS,Si,De pago!!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Miguel,Biases in elections with well-informed voters: Evidence from public voting for football awards,"Objectives: How much does group membership influence voting behavior? This article adds to existing work by considering a novel context where voting is public and voters are well-informed. Methods: The article analyzes public votes in a prominent award for the best football player in the world. It uses ordered probit regressions to assess the extent to which votes by players, coaches, and journalists are related to national, regional, cultural, racial, and religious affinities between voters and candidates controlling for measures of player performance and celebrity. Results: The estimates indicate that while player performance does matter, a number of group-based characteristics continue to influence voting. Some of these effects appear to be rooted in incentives—a tendency to vote for co-nationals and teammates—but others—such as a tendency to vote based on geographical, racial, and religious similarities—are rooted more in group affinities. Conclusions: The analysis provides relatively strong support for the group-based theory of democracy championed by Achen and Bartels as opposed to a theory of democracy founded on individual rational choice. The specific case considered suggests that more attention should be given to the composition of juries that choose the winners of prizes. © 2022 The Authors.

,Searching for the Effects of Momentum in Tennis and its Applications,"In sports, a team or athlete may feel they have momentum, or “power/strength” during a game, but this phenomenon is difficult to measure. Furthermore, it is not clear how various events during a match create or change momentum. This paper presents an approach to quantifying ‘momentum' by introducing a composite model integrating a Logistic Regression Model and a LASSO-based Sparse ARMAX Model to predict momentum shifts and guide strategic decisions during games. The combined model addresses both static and dynamic aspects of momentum, culminating in a comprehensive prediction of momentum trends. The model's robustness is evidenced by its high accuracy rates across different tennis matches and gender scenarios (95.6%, 94.9%, and 95.5%).

,A point-based Bayesian hierarchical model to predict the outcome of tennis matches,"A well-established assumption in tennis is that point outcomes on each player’s serve in a match are independent and identically distributed (iid). With this assumption, it is enough to specify the serve probabilities for both players to derive a wide variety of event distributions, such as the expected winner and number of sets, and number of games. However, models using this assumption, which we will refer to as “point-based”, have typically performed worse than other models in the literature at predicting the match winner. This paper presents a point-based Bayesian hierarchical model for predicting the outcome of tennis matches. The model predicts the probability of winning a point on serve given surface, tournament and match date. Each player is given a serve and return skill which is assumed to follow a Gaussian random walk over time. In addition, each player’s skill varies by surface, and tournaments are given tournament-specific intercepts. When evaluated on the ATP’s 2014 season, the model outperforms other point-based models, predicting match outcomes with greater accuracy (68.8% vs. 66.3%) and lower log loss (0.592 vs. 0.641). The results are competitive with approaches modelling the match outcome directly, demonstrating the forecasting potential of the point-based modelling approach. © 2019 Walter de Gruyter GmbH.

Miguel,"Match Analysis in Women’s Tennis on Clay, Grass and Hard Courts","(1) Background: Performance indicators in tennis such as service effectiveness, rally length or final shots are key factors in determining the winner of the match, although there is little research in the female category. The purpose of this research is to understand the game model in female tennis based on the type of surface. (2) Methods: A total of 2759 points were analyzed from three Grand Slam tournaments from 2019 on three different surfaces. We used observational methodology. (3) Results: The effectiveness of the first service was 62.4% on clay, 64.2% on grass and 67.5% on hard court. With the second service, effectiveness reduced in 5.5%, 11.2% and 14.5% from the first service, respectively. The service direction determines the efficiency and duration of the rally. The highest efficiency occurs with first serves to the T zone or wide zone (regardless of the service side) in short rallies (from 64.9% on clay to 86.3% on hard court). Serving to the centre reduces the chances of success (between 53.1% and 69.9%) and increases the rally length. Between 64.8% (clay) and 75.9% (hard court) of points played on first serve ended in a short rally, while on second serve it was 56.2% (clay) to 61.7% (grass). (4) Conclusions: The data of the effectiveness of the sequences of specific plays can help in the trainings of professional female tennis players. © 2022 by the authors.

Miguel,Comparative Analysis of the Offensive Effectiveness in Winner and Losing Handball Teams,"The purpose of this study was to determine differences related to the offensive process between winning and losing teams among teams participating in the European Handball Federation Champions League (EHFCL) in 55 matches across five seasons. The key indicators used in this study are the offensive actions, team possession type and the zones of the field, goals, and shooting effectiveness. A total of 34 indicators were analyzed and compared using Mann–Whitney U tests. Sixteen key indicators are identified to confirm differences both from the aspect of the collective game in terms of assists (9.10 ± 2.75 vs. 7.29 ± 2.65), goals of positional attack (21.38 ± 4.60 vs. 18.20 ± 3.62) and from the aspect of individual goals from 6 m (16.67 ± 3.98 vs. 13.64 ± 3.70), and the effectiveness of shots (68.19 ± 6.83 vs. 59.41 ± 6.33). Winning teams performed better regarding the variables that defined the effectiveness of offensive shots, especially successful positioned attacks and fast attacks. They also had a greater number of assists. The profiles of the most successful teams can help coaches and practitioners to achieve better performances adjusting the training process according the performance indicators that seem to lead more often to success. © Copyright © 2020 Ferrari, Dias, Sousa, Sarmento and Vaz.",10.3389/fpsyg.2020.547110,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85092274337&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2020.547110&partnerID=40&md5=dab03e93ea5d8684c40cabb075cd649d,SCOPUS,No,Se centran en indicadores y estadísticas que sirven para mejorar el rendimiento o focalizar en los entrenamiento y no a la hora de realizar una apuesta.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,A hybrid random forest to predict soccer matches in international tournaments,"In this work, we propose a new hybrid modeling approach for the scores of international soccer matches which combines random forests with Poisson ranking methods. While the random forest is based on the competing teams’ covariate information, the latter method estimates ability parameters on historical match data that adequately reflect the current strength of the teams. We compare the new hybrid random forest model to its separate building blocks as well as to conventional Poisson regression models with regard to their predictive performance on all matches from the four FIFA World Cups 2002–2014. It turns out that by combining the random forest with the team ability parameters from the ranking methods as an additional covariate the predictive power can be improved substantially. Finally, the hybrid random forest is used (in advance of the tournament) to predict the FIFA World Cup 2018. To complete our analysis on the previous World Cup data, the corresponding 64 matches serve as an independent validation data set and we are able to confirm the compelling predictive potential of the hybrid random forest which clearly outperforms all other methods including the betting odds. © 2019 Walter de Gruyter GmbH.

Miguel,Does The Betting Industry Price Gender? Evidence from Professional Tennis,"This research addresses the importance of gender in the pricing process of the sports betting industry. Specifically, we investigate the impact of gender in the prices that bookmakers offer for tennis matches. Despite widespread evidence of gender bias both in the practice of the sport and its media coverage, tennis is one of the sports that has done most to achieve equality. The analysis of 51,881 tennis matches reveals that betting firms quote higher prices for women's matches than for men's, even when considering uncertainty due to the surprise factor and the media attention. The separate analysis of two bookmakers strengthens the evidence for the role of media attention as a source of gender-related information asymmetry. © The Author(s) 2021.",10.1177/15270025211071026,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85122142261&doi=10.1177%2f15270025211071026&partnerID=40&md5=f7909669d500a9b31330bf76945c7af8,SCOPUS,No,Habla sobre estadísticas en el número de apuestas,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Differences in competition statistics between winners and losers in male and female tennis players in Olympic Games; [Unterschiede in Wettkampfstatistiken zwischen Siegern und Verlierern unter männlichen und weiblichen Tennisspielern bei den Olympischen Spielen],"The aim of this study was to examine differences in the performance indicators between winners and losers in male and female high-level tennis players. A total of 128 tennis singles matches played on grass court surface at the London 2012 Olympic Games were analyzed. Data were collected from the official website of the Olympics and the following groups of variables were analyzed: serve variables (n = 7), serve return variables (n = 3) and game-related variables (n = 5). The results showed that winners had greater (p < 0.05) values of second serve (%), aces, first and second serve points won (%), points won on first and second serve return (%), break points played and break points won (%). Furthermore, they get more winners with both groundstrokes and net points won (%) than losers in both sexes. Losers also committed more doubles faults than winners, and in the male category more unforced errors, whereas female winners get higher serve maximum speed (p < 0.05). Performance indicators according to the result of the match predicted that break points won, first serve points won (%) and first serve return points won (%) are the most relevant variables in males (SC = 0.434; SC = 0.340; SC = 0.327), whereas it was the break points won (SC = −0.372) in females. Therefore, coaches should consider the variation of the competition statistics by gender if they want to enhance the chances of success of their players. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Deutschland, ein Teil von Springer Nature.",10.1007/s12662-019-00608-y,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85071177990&doi=10.1007%2fs12662-019-00608-y&partnerID=40&md5=58a949e5278a3a4b6bcdf958289864e3,SCOPUS,Si,,p-valor,Analisis Estadistico,Tenis,,"masculino, femenino",Sí,Ninguno,"128 partidos, 64 chicas 65 chicos",Temporary variables  Match time Total match time in minutes Variables related to serve  Aces Number of direct serves Doubles faults  Number of doubles faults First serve in (%) Number of first serve in ÷ Number of points play at first serve  Second serve in (%) Number of second serve in ÷ Number of points play at second serve  First serve points won (%) Number of points won with first serve ÷ Number of points play with first serve Second serve points won (%) Number of points won with second serve ÷ Number of points play with second serve Serve Maximum Speed  The highest serve velocity    Variables related to returns  Return of first serve points won (%) Number of points won on first serve return ÷ Number of points play at first serve return Return of second serve points won (%) Number of points won on second serve return ÷ Number of points play at second serve return Break points  Total break points  Breaks  Break points won  Break points won (%) Break points won ÷ Break points played    Variables related with net play performance  Net points won (%) Number of points won at the net ÷ Number of points play at the net Variables related to winners and unforced errors  Winners  Total winners  Forehand winners  Total forehand winners  Backhand winners  Total backhand winners  Unforced errors  Total unforced errors  ,público,(https://www.olympic.org/london-2012),Examinar las diferencias en los indicadores de rendimiento entre ganadores y perdedores en jugadores de tenis masculinos y femeninos,Performance Statistics,"Los resultados mostraron que los ganadores presentaron valores significativamente mayores en:​

,A Combinatorial Approach in Predicting the Outcome of Tennis Matches,"Tennis, as one of the most popular individual sports in the world, holds an important role in the betting world. There are two main categories of bets: pre-match betting, which is conducted before the match starts, and live betting, which allows placing bets during the sporting event. Betting systems rely on setting sports odds, something historically done by domain experts. Setting odds for live betting represents a challenge due to the need to follow events in real-time and react accordingly. In tennis, hierarchical models often stand out as a popular choice when trying to predict the outcome of the match. These models commonly leverage a recursive approach that aims to predict the winner or the final score starting at any point in the match. However, recursive expressions inherently contain computational complexity which hinders the efficiency of methods relying on them. This paper proposes a more resource-effective alternative in the form of a combinatorial approach based on a binomial distribution. The resulting accuracy of the combinatorial approach is identical to that of the recursive approach while being vastly more efficient when considering the execution time, making it a superior choice for live betting in this domain.  © 2021 Ana Šarčević et al., published by Sciendo.",10.34768/amcs-2021-0036,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85117068724&doi=10.34768%2famcs-2021-0036&partnerID=40&md5=277a44c991b8a8fa41817b7ccbd79ab5,SCOPUS,Si,,Accuracy,Analisis Estadistico,Tenis,,masculino,,No se indica,No se indica,"La característica principal del modelo es la probabilidad de que un jugador gane un punto en su propio servicio.

Miguel,Comparison of the service and reception between winning and defeated high-level table tennis athletes,"The aim of the present study was to compare service and reception in winning and defeated Table Tennis athletes. The sample of the survey consisted of 64 games (34 men and 30 women) of the A1 Table Tennis Greek national league, where a total of 5,065 points were analysed between 33 male athletes and 18 female athletes, who are among the best 32 of the official Hellenic Table Tennis Federation ranking. The variables analysed were: service grip, service execution length, reception technique, reception movement, the point conquest of the serving athlete and the point advantage in the first three hits. The non-parametric-square test(x2) showed that statistically significant differences were found between winning and defeated men, in the length of the service, with winners having a more effective service and more offensive reception. As for the female athletes, statistically significant differences were found in the grip and length of the service between winning and defeated women, while it was found that the winners have better service, perform defensive shots in the reception, and have an advantage in the first three hits. The above findings will help high-level athletes, coaches, physical trainers and performance analysts in understanding the importance of serving and receiving in high-level Table Tennis. © 2023 University of Alicante",10.14198/jhse.2023.183.13,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85165000731&doi=10.14198%2fjhse.2023.183.13&partnerID=40&md5=740ee7acc98fb62ab06fc1cd0b7f44a4,SCOPUS,No,"Estudio sobre comportamientos y estadisticas que no deteminan un resultado, y, por tanto, no son útiles a la hora de realizar una apuesta",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Identification of serve pacing strategies during five-set tennis matches,"This study aims to investigate the prominence of different pacing strategies adopted by male professional tennis players during five-set matches and their relationship with match outcome, ATP ranking and Grand Slam tournament. Fifty five-set matches of the 2014 Grand Slam tournaments were analyzed. First and second serve velocities, percentages of first serve in, and percentages of first and second serve points won were collected for each of the five sets. According to the fluctuations of mean first serve velocity for each of the five sets, players were classified into five types of pacing strategies: ‘variable’, ‘parabolic’, ‘constant’, ‘all-out’ and ‘negative-split’. Professional players mostly used ‘variable’ pacing strategy (45%), followed by ‘parabolic’ (20%), ‘constant’ (18%) and ‘all-out’ (15%) strategies, which are closely distributed. Finally, ‘negative-split’ strategy (2%) is infrequently used. The pacing strategy used by players tends to exert an influence on match outcome (P = 0.072). There is no significant association between players’ ranking and type of pacing strategy used (P = 0.384). There is no significant association between Grand Slam tournaments and type of pacing strategy used (P = 0.875). Serve velocity and serve points won are significantly decreased in losers, while they are increased or kept constant in winners during the fifth set of the match. ‘Negative split’, ‘variable’ and ‘parabolic’ strategies seem to be the most effective for winning five-set match, while ‘all-out’ strategy appears ineffective since when players used it, they lost the match in 73% of cases. Moreover, tennis players should consider physical conditioning programs to avoid decreases in serve velocity and percentage during the fifth set of a tennis match. © The Author(s) 2018.",10.1177/1747954118806682,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85058860492&doi=10.1177%2f1747954118806682&partnerID=40&md5=cf1f0e71e5d38bcda5eba1e0d33869d5,SCOPUS,Si,,p-valor,Analisis Estadistico,Tenis,Grand Slam,masculino,,No se realiza,50 partidos,"Velocidad del primer y segundo servicio.​

Miguel,Application of Tactics in Technical and Tactical Analysis of Table Tennis Mixed Doubles Based on Artificial Intelligence Graph Theory Model,"Objective. To construct the graph theory model and grey correlation model of table tennis mixed doubles technology and tactics so as to provide a new research method for the analysis of table tennis mixed doubles technology and tactics. The method of graphic theory and video observation is used to study the top tactical indicators of the game, and the method of graphic theory and video observation is used to analyze the tactical data of men and women, which has a certain contribution to the world level of table tennis. The grey correlation analysis can be better applied to the technical and tactical analysis of table tennis mixed doubles. The analysis of the contribution rate of men and women in eight rounds shows that there is little difference in the net average score between male and female athletes, and female athletes are slightly higher than male athletes. The net average score of the serving round is much higher than that of the receiving round, which shows that the serving round has certain advantages for the server, and the winner is often better able to grasp the opportunity of the serving round and get higher scores. Male athletes should strengthen physical training and adapt to a higher level of confrontation.  © 2022 Yecheng Cao et al.",10.1155/2022/6543953,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85131341901&doi=10.1155%2f2022%2f6543953&partnerID=40&md5=75e916d41511a4d757622375cf6494fd,SCOPUS,No,Estudio de estadísticas no relevantes a la hora de realizar una apuesta.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Technical, tactical and movement analysis of men’s professional tennis on hard courts","BACKGROUND There is very little information in tennis relating performance to both the movement of the players and the effectiveness of their shots. This study aimed to identify differences between winners and losers in the volume and intensity of their movements, as well as in the effectiveness of their shots. METHODS Matches (N.=8) at the 2011 ATP 500 tournament in Valencia (Spain) were recorded and analyzed using SAGIT, a computerized vision-tracking system. Data were split into points for movement analysis, and into games for stroke analysis. RESULTS: Players winning points used more offensive strategies and spent more time in the offensive zone than point losers. They also forced point losers to cover more distance at a higher speed. Game winners hit more winning shots, made fewer unforced errors, and were more effective than game losers. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that winner players controlled the game by playing more offensively and forcing losers to play in defensive positions, move greater distances at a faster speed, and make more errors. © 2017 EDIZIONI MINERVA MEDICA",10.23736/S0022-4707.17.07916-6,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85058736336&doi=10.23736%2fS0022-4707.17.07916-6&partnerID=40&md5=39a84fe7bbb1007b5d82b97eb57e414c,SCOPUS,Si,De pago!!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Comparisons of technical-tactical and physical performance variables were done between different sets; and the within-match coefficients of variation (CV) of these variables were contrasted between match winning and losing players. All comparisons were realized via standardized (Cohen's d) mean differences and uncertainty in the true differences was assessed using non-clinical magnitude-based inferences. Results showed that there was possibly to very likely decreases in the serve, net and running related variables (mean difference, ±90%CL:-0.16, ±0.14 to-0.45, ±0.24, small) and an increase in the return and winner related variables (0.17, ±0.24 to 0.24, ±0.14, small) in the last sets when compared to the initial sets, indicating the influence of match fatigue and the player's choice of match tactics and pacing strategy. Besides, winning players were revealed to have lower CV values in most of performance variables (-0.16, ±0.24 to-0.82, ±0.23, small to moderate) except for the second serve, winner, and physical performance variables (0.25, ±0.26 to 1.6, ±0.25, small to large), indicating that they would sacrifice the consistency to gain more aggressiveness and to dominate the match. © 2020 Yixiong Cui, Haoyang Liu, Miguel-Ángel Gómez, Hongyou Liu, Bruno Gonçalves, published by Sciendo 2020.",10.2478/hukin-2019-0140,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089173544&doi=10.2478%2fhukin-2019-0140&partnerID=40&md5=963abc73b976ff6ebc2891ba5e2e998d,SCOPUS,Si,,"cuantiles, mediana, p-valor",Analisis Estadistico,Tenis,Grand Slam,masculino,Sí,Creación de nuevas variables a partir de datos existentes,146 partidos,"Porcentaje de aces.​

,Machine Learning in Tennis Match Analysis: Predicting Score Point Victor and Momentum Shift,"In tennis and other competitive sports, momentum plays a pivotal role, where actions like consecutive scoring can enhance a player's momentum and increase his chances of winning the match. Quantifying momentum and predicting match outcomes in real-time are critical for both scientific training and strategic decision-making in the sports industry. However, traditional forecasting approaches often overlook the cumulative nature of time-series data and lack quantitative analysis of the dynamic properties influencing match outcomes. In this study, we compare seven machine learning models across two key tasks: predicting the winner of the next point and identifying the critical moment of momentum transition. We introduce a novel momentum formula to quantify the win/loss trends throughout a match. Our experiments using data from the 2023 Wimbledon Championships, demonstrate up to 70% accuracy in predicting point winners using logistic regression (LR) and up to 97% accuracy in detecting momentum shifts via a light gradient boosting machine (LGBM). These findings underscore the significance of momentum in tennis and offer valuable insights for performance optimization and competitive strategy development.",10.1109/ICMLCA63499.2024.10753948,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10753948,IEEE,Si,De pago!!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Which defensive tactical indicators are associated with victory in the semifinals and finals of the 2014 FIFA World Cup?,"Aim: The objective of this study was to verify whether the match winners in the semifinals and finals of the FIFA World Cup 2014 were those who presented the highest frequency of pressing and intense behaviors in the recovery of ball possession. Methods: The sample was composed of 533 defensive tactical sequences performed by the four finalist teams in the 2014 FIFA World Cup. The independent t-test was used to compare tactical indicators between winning and losing teams and the chi-square test (X2) was applied to assess the association between the variables. Results: In the first (X2 = 48.47; P < 0.01) and second halves of regular matches (X2 = 64.10; P < 0.01), the evaluated teams recovered the ball in the defensive zone. However, during the first and second periods of extra time, the highest frequencies of ball recovery were found in the middle defensive zone (P < 0.01). Conclusion: It is concluded that the semi-finalist and finalist teams from the 2014 FIFA World Cup sought to recover the ball in the defensive zone, and pressing opponent movements when they were losing the matches. © 2020 Universidade Estadual Paulista - UNESP.

,A multidimensional momentum chain model for tennis matches based on difference equations,"In the process of pushing the limits of human performance, competitive sports are dedicated to the pursuit of excellence. In this context, the concept of momentum has gained significant attention, as it is widely acknowledged to influence the outcomes of competitions. The question of whether momentum affects sports psychology and the mechanisms underlying its generation and influence merits thorough investigation. In this paper, taking the 7,284 scoring points in the men's singles tennis match at Wimbledon 2023 as an example, we expand upon traditional momentum research by integrating diverse algorithms, including statistical analysis and linear weighting, to construct a multidimensional momentum chain model predicated on difference equations, which aims to quantify the momentum dynamics for athletes in a match. To enhance the authenticity of our model, we incorporate a forgetting curve to modulate the momentum fluctuations. The results show that dominant players have significantly shorter running distances and higher success rates in net strokes than disadvantaged players, indicating that positive events markedly enhance players' psychological and behavioral performance. Furthermore, the likelihood of scoring is substantially greater for players possessing higher momentum, with data suggesting that the serving side has an 84% chance of securing a match victory. When applied to 6,870 tennis matches, our model achieves a prediction accuracy exceeding 80%. Accordingly, we have proposed tennis training suggestions based on the mechanisms of momentum and developed strategies to effectively harness the hot hand phenomenon in matches.",10.1371/journal.pone.0316542,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0316542,WOS,Si,,Accuracy,"Random Forest, Analisis Estadistico",Tenis,Grand Slam,masculino,No,Eliminación de outliers y estudio de nuevas variables a partir de observar correlaciones entre variables dependientes e independientes,6870 international tennis matches from 2011–2023,"Distancia recorrida por los jugadores.​

Miguel,Forecasting the Next Shot Location in Tennis Using Fine-Grained Spatiotemporal Tracking Data,"In professional sport, an enormous amount of fine-grain performance data can be generated at near millisecond intervals in the form of vision-based tracking data. One of the first sports to embrace this technology has been tennis, where Hawk-Eye technology has been used to both aid umpiring decisions, and to visualize shot trajectories for broadcast purposes. Despite the high-level of accuracy of the tracking systems and the sheer volume of spatiotemporal data they generate, the use of this data for player performance analysis and prediction has been lacking. In this research, we use ball and player tracking data from “Hawk-Eye” to discover unique player styles and predict within-point events. We move beyond current analysis that only incorporates coarse match statistics (i.e., serves, winners, number of shots, and volleys) and use spatial and temporal information which better characterizes the tactics and tendencies of each player. Using a probabilistic graphical model, we are able to model player behaviors which enables us to: 1) find the factors such as location and speed of the incoming shot which are most conducive to a player hitting a winner (i.e., “sweet-spot”) or cause an error, and 2) do “live in-point” prediction - based on the shots being played during a rally we estimate the probability of the outcome (e.g., winner, continuation, or error) and the location of the next shot. As player behavior depends on the opponent, we use model adaptation to enhance our prediction. We show the utility of our approach by analyzing the play of Djokovic, Nadal, and Federer at the 2012 Australian Tennis Open.",10.1109/TKDE.2016.2594787,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7523410,IEEE,No,No se puede realizar apuestas sobre el siguiente golpe.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Research on the influence of momentum evaluation model on professional tennis players,"This study analyzes the impact of psychological momentum (PM) on score fluctuations in male tennis players. t employs Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to create a Real-Time Momentum Evaluation Model, comprising three principal components: ""Offense,"" ""Stability,"" and ""Defense."" Meanwhile, changes in momentum are plotted to reflect player performance throughout the game. A Randomized Testing model is developed to assess momentum randomness. It reveals a significant correlation (96%) between maximum momentum scores and game winners. This study introduces a randomized permutation test, indicating that momentum is unlikely to be random, further supporting these findings. A Turning Point Prediction Model is introduced to forecast game fluctuations, defining turning points as instances where the momentum difference exceeds a threshold. By analyzing the importance ranking of determining factors, this study identifies the top three main influencing factors as the number of games played, break points won, and player scores. © 2024 SPIE.",10.1117/12.3036529,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85200346076&doi=10.1117%2f12.3036529&partnerID=40&md5=04f0f230ed19de5e7c6164f0fcaff944,SCOPUS,Si,,"Accuracy, MSE, r2",Gradient Boosting,Tenis,,masculino,,"Estudio de los datos obtenidos, identificando las principales características entre todas las disponibles",No se indica,"The win percentage of Player 1 - Personal ability

Miguel,Shot-by-shot stochastic modeling of individual tennis points,"Individual tennis points evolve over time and space, as each of the two opposing players are constantly reacting and positioning themselves in response to strikes of the ball. However, these reactions are diminished into simple tally statistics such as the amount of winners or unforced errors a player has. In this paper, a new way is proposed to evaluate how an individual tennis point is evolving, by measuring how many points a player can expect from each shot, given who struck the shot and where both players are located. This measurement, named ""Expected Shot Value"" (ESV), derives from stochastically modeling each shot of individual tennis points. The modeling will take place on multiple resolutions, differentiating between the continuous player movement and discrete events such as strikes occurring and duration of shots ending. Multi-resolution stochastic modeling allows for the incorporation of information-rich spatiotemporal player-tracking data, while allowing for computational tractability on large amounts of data. In addition to estimating ESV, this methodology will be able to identify the strengths and weaknesses of specific players, which will have the ability to guide a player's in-match strategy. © 2020 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2020.",10.1515/jqas-2018-0036,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85074299287&doi=10.1515%2fjqas-2018-0036&partnerID=40&md5=f6a44754d6208353fc1b3d70e0acb51b,SCOPUS,No,No se puede realizar apuesta sobre puntos individuales.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,IN-GAME WIN PROBABILITIES FOR THE NATIONAL RUGBY LEAGUE,"This paper develops new methods for providing instantaneous in-game win probabilities for the National Rugby League. Besides the score differential, betting odds, and real-time features extracted from the match event data are also used as inputs to inform the in-game win probabilities. Rugby matches evolve continuously in time, and the circumstances change over the duration of the match. Therefore, the match data are considered as functional data, and the in-game win probability is a function of the time of the match. We express the in-game win probability using a conditional probability formulation, the components of which are evaluated from the perspective of functional data analysis. Specifically, we model the score differential process and functional feature extracted from the match event data as sums of mean functions and noises. The mean functions are approximated by B-spline basis expansions with functional parameters. Since each match is conditional on a unique kickoff win probability of the home team obtained from the betting odds (i.e., the functional data are not independent and identically distributed), we propose a weighted least squares method to estimate the functional parameters by borrowing the information from matches with similar kickoff win probabilities. The variance and covariance elements are obtained by the maximum likelihood estimation method. The proposed method is applicable to other sports when suitable match event data are available. © Institute of Mathematical Statistics, 2022.",10.1214/21-AOAS1514,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85127824540&doi=10.1214%2f21-AOAS1514&partnerID=40&md5=088658476dfeabf4b901d16262e3a7a2,SCOPUS,Si,,Accuracy,Analisis Estadistico,Rugby,,masculino,,"Crear nuevas variables, por ejemplo, se crean diferencias entre puntuaciones según el momento del partido",Temporadas desde 2016 hasta 2019,"Diferencia de puntuación en tiempo real.​

,Forecasting Tennis Match Results Using the Bradley-Terry Model,"Forecasting has been playing an important role in different fields of life, i.e., in decision-making activities of management, to predict uncertain events within an organization, in weather forecasting, in flood forecasting, etc. Stakeholders involved in betting market take advantage of tennis forecasting directly or indirectly. Winning probability calculated using forecasting models helps the bettors in deciding whether to place a bet or not. Keeping in view the importance of tennis forecasting, the Bradley-Terry model is used to model men's professional tennis for predicting match outcomes in tennis matches of men's singles. Model coefficients are estimated using data from January 2019 to September 2020 of 3439 matches. Ratings for each player are calculated using model coefficients. Player rankings are then calculated using these ratings. Comparison of model rankings with ATP rankings has shown satisfactory results. Winning probability for each player is calculated using model coefficients and ratings. These probability predictions are evaluated against four measures of performance. The results reveal that surface on which a game is played on contributes significantly towards a player's performance. Due to this impact of the surface, our model has produced superior player rankings for certain players who had been ranked very low in official ATP rankings. According to most of the performance measures, the model has shown good results for clay court data which are closely followed by hard court data. To calculate return on investment, model results are compared with the bookmakers' average odds and best available odds. It has been found that return on investment for a fitted model is highest in the case of clay court data in comparison to bookmaker's average odds and best odds.  © 2022 Aisha Fayomi et al.",10.1155/2022/1898132,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85126988907&doi=10.1155%2f2022%2f1898132&partnerID=40&md5=e374fecc7a6b7a461626aee80bef30a5,SCOPUS,Si,,Accuracy,Bradley-Terry,Tenis,,masculino,,No se indica,2439 partidos,"Habilidades relativas de los jugadores.​

Miguel,Comparisons of mood states associated with outcomes achieved by female and male athletes in high-level judo and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu championships: Psychological factors associated with the probability of success,"Brandt, R, Bevilacqua, GG, Crocetta, TB, Monteiro, CBdM, Guarnieri, R, Hobold, E, Flores, LJF, Miarka, B, and Andrade, A. Comparisons of mood states associated with outcomes achieved by female and male athletes in high-level judo and Brazilian jiujitsu championships: psychological factors associated with the probability of success. J Strength Cond Res 35(9): 2518-2524, 2019-Moods can be used to predict the performance of athletes in various sports; accordingly, we selected the Brunel Mood Scale (BRUMS) to evaluate mood states of high-level judo and Brazilian jiu-jitsu (BJJ) athletes. The aims of this study were (a) to compare the mood states of high-level female and male athletes in BJJ and judo championships in relation to their performance outcomes and (b) to verify associations between psychological factors and performance in estimating their probability of success. The subjects were 173 grappling athletes (judo, n = 85 and BJJ, n = 88), separated into male (n = 129, 40 winners and 89 nonwinners) and female (n = 44, 23 winners and 21 nonwinners) groups. Each subject's mood state was assessed 60 minutes before the first match using the BRUMS (tension, depression, anger, vigor, fatigue, and mental confusion dimensions). Descriptive and inferential statistics (including logistic regression and variance analysis) were used to evaluate relations between mood states and performance (i.e., winning/losing), with p ≤ 0.05. Analysis showed significant differences between male and female athletes in vigor and fatigue, and differences betweenmale judo and male BJJ athletes in tension, vigor, confusion, and fatigue. Female judo and female BJJ athletes showed significant differences in depression and vigor. Logistic regression revealed that higher levels of anger and tension increased athletes' chances of performing well in amatch by 23 and 13%, respectively. In addition, lower levels of depression increased athletes' chances of better performance by up to 32%. Overall, we observed a significant relationship between mood state and sports performance. Thus, coaching staff and athletes should monitor athletes' mood states before competitions to ensure that they are in optimal condition to perform and use psychological interventions to support judo and BJJ preparation.  © 2019 National Strength and Conditioning Association.",10.1519/JSC.0000000000003218,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85114902630&doi=10.1519%2fJSC.0000000000003218&partnerID=40&md5=6a08d454a769640b6379c926506117b3,SCOPUS,No,Análisis de características que no se pueden utilizar a la hora de realizar una apuesta.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,A comparative evaluation of Elo ratings- and machine learning-based methods for tennis match result prediction,"Elo ratings-based methods, including the recently proposed Weighted Elo method, have been found to perform well when forecasting tennis match results, however, whether they can outperform machine learning (ML) has not been established. In this study, a comparative evaluation of the two types of methods is conducted using the Sports Result Prediction CRISP-DM experimental framework. The first full year of mens ATP tennis data (2006), in a dataset containing matches from 2005 to 2020, was set to be the initial training set and 1 year of data was incrementally added to this set to predict 14 test years, from 2007 to 2020. Features were ranked based on their average rank across five feature selection techniques. It was found that, of the five ML models, Alternating Decision Trees (ADTrees) and Logistic Regression achieved higher accuracies than Elo ratings and similar accuracies to predictions derived from betting odds. Furthermore, ADTrees show potential in this domain, with solid performance achieved with an interpretable decision tree that allows for variation in the average betting odds difference threshold. © IMechE 2023.",10.1177/17543371231212235,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85176744007&doi=10.1177%2f17543371231212235&partnerID=40&md5=67550639fc3e7e4b48a6210724170360,SCOPUS,Si,,Accuracy,"Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, SVC, Red Neuronal, Random Forest",Tenis,,masculino,Sí,CRISP-DM,Partidos desde 2005 hasta 2020,"Diferencia de puntuación Elo entre los jugadores.​

Miguel,Effect of a Seeding System on Competitive Performance of Elite Players During Major Tennis Tournaments,"The performance of professional tennis players in the four major Grand Slam tournaments has always been an important research topic, which advances the understanding of the current development of tennis. However, there is little known about the difference between higher-ranked and lower-ranked players considering match performance statistics. The study was aimed to explore the technical, tactical, and physical performance indicators that best discriminate seeded and non-seeded male players in Grand Slams. A total of 549 matches played by 189 individual players during 2015–2017 Grand Slam men’s singles were sampled, with corresponding match statistics gathered for each player observation, concerning players’ serving, returning, net point, break point, efficiency, and physical performance. The results showed that the seeded players outperformed the non-seeded players in serve and return, break point, net point, and efficiency-related indicators, while the following indicators contributed most to the separation of two player categories: serve and return of serve points won (%), ace (%), peak serve speed, net points won (%), break point per return game, break point saved, winner and unforced error ratio, and dominance ratio. The research findings evidenced the decreased competitive balance in men’s competition during Grand Slams due to a rank-based seeding system, whereas coaches could use the information to fine-tune the training benchmarks and match planning. © Copyright © 2020 Cui, Zhao, Liu, Gómez, Wei and Liu.",10.3389/fpsyg.2020.01294,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85087731306&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2020.01294&partnerID=40&md5=0a5ee76f83b06a5543e1c869ec096a6d,SCOPUS,No,Características no relevantes a la hora de realizar una apuesta.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Random forest model identifies serve strength as a key predictor of tennis match outcome,"Tennis is a popular sportworldwide, boasting millions of fans and numerous national and international tournaments. Like many sports, tennis has benefitted from the popularity of rigorous record-keeping of game and player information, as well as the growth of machine learning methods for use in sports analytics. Of particular interest to bettors and betting companies alike is potential use of sports records to predict tennis match outcomes prior to match start. We compiled, cleaned, and used the largest database of tennis match information to date to predict match outcome using fairly simple machine learning methods. Using such methods allows for rapid fit and prediction times to readily incorporate new data and make real-time predictions. We were able to predict match outcomes with upwards of 80% accuracy, much greater than predictions using betting odds alone, and identify serve strength as a key predictor of match outcome. By combining prediction accuracies from three models, we were able to nearly recreate a probability distribution based on average betting odds from betting companies, which indicates that betting companies are using similar information to assign odds to matches. These results demonstrate the capability of relatively simple machine learning models to quite accurately predict tennis match outcomes.",10.3233/JSA-200515,http://dx.doi.org/10.3233/JSA-200515,WOS,Si,,Accuracy,"Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine",Tenis,,masculino,,No se indica,Volumen alto de partidos,"Porcentaje de puntos ganados en el primer servicio.​

,A Bayesian in-play prediction model for association football outcomes,"Point process models have made a significant contribution to the prediction of football association outcomes. It is conventionally the case that defence and attack capabilities have been assumed to be constant during a match and estimated against the average performance of all other teams in history. Drawing upon a Bayesian method, this paper proposes a dynamic strength model which relaxes assumption of the constant teams' strengths and permits applying in-match performance information to calibrate them. An empirical study demonstrates that although the Bayesian model fails to achieve improvement in goal difference prediction, it registers clear achievements with regard to the prediction of the total number of goals and Win/Draw/Loss outcome prediction. When the Bayesianmodel bets against the SBOBet bookmaker, one of themost popular gaming companies among Asian handicaps fans, whose odds data were obtained from both the Win/Draw/Loss market and over-under market, it may obtain positive returns; this clearly contrasts with the process model with constant strengths, which fails to win money from the bookmaker. © 2020 by the authors.",10.3390/APP10082904,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85085319754&doi=10.3390%2fAPP10082904&partnerID=40&md5=93276637a1f0046b4cc1db56c3ecc434,SCOPUS,Si,De pago!!!!!!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Sports prediction and betting models in the machine learning age: The case of tennis,"Machine learning and its numerous variants have meanwhile become established tools in many areas of society. Several attempts have been made to apply machine learning to the prediction of the outcome of professional sports events and to exploit inefficiencies in the corresponding betting markets. On the example of tennis, this paper extends previous research by conducting one of the most extensive studies of its kind and applying a wide range of machine learning techniques to male and female professional singles matches. The paper shows that the average prediction accuracy cannot be increased to more than about 70%. Irrespective of the used model, most of the relevant information is embedded in the betting markets, and adding other match- and player-specific data does not lead to any significant improvement. Returns from applying predictions to the sports betting market are subject to high volatility and mainly negative over the longer term. This conclusion holds across most tested models, various money management strategies, and for backing the match favorites or outsiders.

,Nash equilibrium and tennis serve performance: a game theory analysis,"This study presents an in-depth analysis of the serve in men’s singles tennis matches at Wimbledon based on game theory, with the quantitative tool of the stroke performance relevance (SPR) model. This model quantifies tennis tactics more precisely, taking “each stroke” as the observation unit, and it includes scoring, losing points, and sequential information. Unlike traditional methods that consider “each point”, the SPR metrics captures the role of specific technical actions throughout the match more comprehensively. While standard serve data like aces and double faults have no significant impact on match outcomes, the serve SPR index does. In a game matrix model with two pure strategy Nash equilibria, both the winner and loser show higher SPR indices than those with fewer equilibria. Winners consistently exhibited a higher serve SPR index, indicating that the two pure strategy Nash equilibria significantly influenced match outcomes on grass courts. This underscores the role of tactical strategies and Nash equilibrium in determining match results, offering scientific and theoretical support for tennis athletes’ and coaches’ tactics. © 2023 Cardiff Metropolitan University.",10.1080/24748668.2023.2256120,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85170552505&doi=10.1080%2f24748668.2023.2256120&partnerID=40&md5=4c6766ac348de6bdfd4a979e7c501983,SCOPUS,Si,,Accuracy,Logistic Regression,Tenis,,"masculino, femenino",Sí,Filtrado de partidos y Normalización,Partidos de granslams desde 2005 a 2017,"Marcador

Miguel,Exploring the Importance of Players' Characteristics and Performance on Serve and Return of Serve in Winning the Women's Singles Grand Slam Tennis Tournaments,"Sports analytics has become very popular in recent years. Many researchers have been using the tools and technique to study tennis player performance in various aspects during matches. However, much of the studies were performed on male players while much less attention were made on female players. This study explores the female players' characteristics and serve performance that leads to winning matches in women's singles 2018 Grand Slam tennis tournaments. Using data provided by the official website of the Women Tennis Association (WTA), 1016 single matches in all four 2018 Grand Slam Tournaments were analysed to evaluate winning traits in tennis specifically looking at the two most important strokes in tennis which are the serve and return of serve. Additionally, other personal player characteristics that would influence the match outcomes were also evaluated. To achieve the objectives of the study, odds ratio and chi-square test were used to compare between the match winner and match loser. The study revealed that percentage of first serve return won (PFSRW) has the highest odds ratio value (OR=1.263) followed by the percentage of first serve won (PFSW) with odds ratio equal to 1.244. These showed that having a good first serve, plays an important factor in increasing the winning odds as compared to second serve either in serve or in return of serve. This study also reveals that a taller player had the advantage over a shorter player for faster serve speed (p-value<0.05). © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",10.1088/1742-6596/1496/1/012008,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85086711443&doi=10.1088%2f1742-6596%2f1496%2f1%2f012008&partnerID=40&md5=7d535ec52c8949a18b74fcc35695178b,SCOPUS,No,Característica no determinante a la hora de realizar una apuesta,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Miguel,Women’s Singles Tennis Match Analysis and Probability of Winning a Point,"(1) Background: The analysis of women’s tennis performance has not been extensively explored by the scientific community, necessitating further research to understand the tactical actions occurring in matches. This research aimed to examine the chance of winning a point in professional women’s tennis based on the key variables that influence performance in the sport. (2) Methods: Data from 3239 points were examined across three distinct court surfaces, sourced from the final rounds (starting with the quarterfinals) of three Grand Slam tournaments in the 2021 season. An observational methodology was employed, using various analysis techniques: descriptive and chi-square analyses, with a significance level of p < 0.05. (3) Results: The probability of winning a point on the first serve was 61% on clay, 70% on grass, and 69% on hard courts. For second serves, the probability of winning the point varied between 55% and 57%, depending on the court surface. Additionally, the majority of points, ranging from 70% to 71%, concluded with short rallies, involving one to four shots. On clay courts, the server won up to 65% of points with a first serve and a short rally, while the success rate increased to 75% on both grass and hard courts. For medium-length rallies (5–8 shots), the probability of winning the point dropped to 55–57%. The point outcome (winner, forced error, and unforced error) varied according to court surface, serve type, and rally length. (4) Conclusions: Descriptive data from this research on the probability of winning a point could assist coaches and players in developing match strategies. © 2024 by the authors.",10.3390/app14156761,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85200914429&doi=10.3390%2fapp14156761&partnerID=40&md5=98dc1281e1d6a997626b57ed70bcc1f5,SCOPUS,No,Es imposible analizar en tiempo real un punto y realizar una apuesta de si va a ganar o no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Miguel,"Physical and technical demand in professional wheelchair tennis on hard, clay and grass surfaces: implication for training","This study analysed and compared the physical and technical demands of professional wheelchair tennis (WT) on different surfaces (clay [C], hard [H] and grass [G] courts). A total of 6,720 shots from thirteen matches played by the best ten professional WT players was analysed. Physical demands (e.g., working time, resting time, shots per point …) and technical and tactical parameters (e.g., serve, effectivity, winner stroke, shots with two bounces …) were recorded and analysed. Most physical parameters (points, shots, duration) differed according to the surface (H > C > G). Point length and shot per point were longer on H, and lower on C and G surfaces (p < 0.001). Differences in technical performance were found mainly between C and G courts, with a high use of volleys on G but fewer winners (p < 0.01). The main finding indicates that the physical and technical demands facing professional WT players differed by surface, showing that the H surface involves a higher external load than the other surfaces. Coaches can use this information to adapt their players’ style depending on the playing surface as well as to design specific training drills according to the surface of play. © 2021 Cardiff Metropolitan University.",10.1080/24748668.2021.1912957,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85104334825&doi=10.1080%2f24748668.2021.1912957&partnerID=40&md5=024247808a31675432ea1ab3d49cd5ef,SCOPUS,No,"Características no determinantes en las apuestas, centradas en entrenamientos",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Miguel,Influence of scaling on match play characteristics in youth tennis: A systematic review,"Scaled tennis is the downsized version of adult tennis and aims to allow youth players to play a type of tennis that resembles adult tennis. However, since the different scaling conditions (red, orange, lime and green tennis court) were chosen pragmatically it is unclear whether the match play characteristics of scaled tennis resemble those of adult tennis. It is also unclear whether the match play characteristics are comparable between the different scaling conditions (allowing a smooth transition through the scaled courts). Therefore, this systematic review aims to compare match play characteristics in scaled tennis to adult tennis, and to compare match play characteristics across the different scaling conditions. The PubMed, Web of Science and SPORTDiscus (EBSCO) databases were searched until November 2021. The match play characteristics included first serve percentage, percentage of first serve points won, percentage of second serve points won, percentage of total serve points won, number of aces, number of double faults, winners’ percentage, unforced errors percentage, percentage of break points won, rally duration and inter contact time. The systematic search identified 887 records and six studies were included. All included match play characteristics, apart from the percentage of second serve points won and a number of double faults, showed significant differences between scaled tennis and adult tennis. Similarly, all included match play characteristics, except for a number of double faults, showed significant differences between the different scaling conditions. Based on these results, future research is needed to optimise the different scaling conditions in terms of match play characteristics. © The Author(s) 2022.",10.1177/17479541221116875,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85135863732&doi=10.1177%2f17479541221116875&partnerID=40&md5=bfaa5c1b9ff5188b28154dedc03f7926,SCOPUS,No,Estudio de características enfocadas a mejorar ascpectos durante el entrenamiento.

Miguel,Comparison of the game structure and point ending during Grand Slam women's doubles tennis,"Despite the importance of doubles tennis, there is little research on this modality of the game, especially as per women play. The aim of this study was to analyse the structural variables and the way points ended in women's doubles, as well as to observe the differences between surfaces and between winning and losing teams. Twenty-one WTA doubles matches from three Grand Slams played on three different surfaces were analysed. Players played 2.0 ± 0.3 sets, 19.9 ± 3.2 games, 130.4 ± 25.3 points, 0.2 ± 0.6 tie breaks per match (PM), 9.5 ± 1.0 games and 62.6 ± 7.9 points per set, and 6.6 ± 0.6 points per game (PG). 33.5% of the points ended with a winner (Wn), 43.6% with a forced error (FE) and 22.8% with an unforced error (UE), with the Wn shot being the variable that most discriminated between winner and loser teams. It was also shown that the way more points were finished was with FE, followed by Wn and UE. There were no significant differences between surfaces in structural variables or point ending. These results showed that in women's doubles playing Wn shots and avoiding UE is crucial to successful performance, so that aggressive play and taking the initiative in the game has a positive influence in the result. © The Author(s) 2022.",10.1177/17479541221098226,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85130288188&doi=10.1177%2f17479541221098226&partnerID=40&md5=d4196bc6b6650941a8ab0c14cfd4b0ee,SCOPUS,No,Es imposible apostar en tiempo real al resultado de un punto.

Miguel,Family ties and social capital among grand slam tennis champions,"As a competitive sport, tennis demands a comprehensive understanding of the factors which contribute to success at different levels of performance. In order to clarify the aforementioned, the aim of this study was to explore and understand the perspective of tennis players, at differing levels of success, and the impact of social capital on their sporting careers. A particular emphasis was put on an elite group of tennis players who succeeded in reaching the pinnacle of success by winning a Grand Slam title. Semistructured interviews were conducted with 30 tennis players, including 10 Grand Slam winners. Upon transcription, the interviews were analyzed by using reflexive thematic analysis. Family presence and support during the challenges faced by tennis players emerged as a clear research topic following the research analysis. The perspectives of tennis players on the influence of social capital on long-term sports development and achievements revealed that the family plays a key role in the process of raising and supporting tennis players. In order to improve the long-term sports development of tennis players, families must ensure and provide a more significant role in the accrual of social capital, however it is not necessarily a sufficient condition to success. © The Author(s) 2025.",10.1177/10126902241298498,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85215513411&doi=10.1177%2f10126902241298498&partnerID=40&md5=48c5b15cffcee8a038710f78904bd191,SCOPUS,No,Habla sobre el origen familiar de los jugadores y la influencia que tiene esta sobre los partidos.

Miguel,Game activity and physiological responses of young tennis players in a competition with 2 consecutive matches in a day,"Purpose: To determine whether the game activity and physiological responses of young tennis players differed depending on the session of play (eg, morning [MOR] vs afternoon [AFT]) and the final match outcome (eg, winners vs losers) during a simulated competition with 2 matches on the same day. Methods: A total of 12 well-trained male tennis players (age 14.5 [0.8] y) took part in a simulated competition of two 3-set matches separated by 3 h. All the matches were video recorded, and the participants were monitored using 10-Hz global positioning system units including a heart-rate monitor. Effect-size (ES) statistics were used to investigate the magnitudes of the differences. Results: During the AFT matches, in absolute terms, players covered longer total distance (ES = moderate) and ran more distance between 0 and ≤4 m·s−1 (ES = small to large) than in MOR matches. Total duration was also longer (ES = large) in the AFT, where the rest time between rallies was also longer (ES = very large). Heart rate was similar during AFT and MOR matches, but higher rates of perceived exertion (ES = moderate) were reported in the AFT. Only peak running velocity was observed to be likely higher for losers than for winners (ES = small). Conclusions: Game activity and physiological responses of young tennis players differ when 2 consecutive matches are played on the same day. These data might help elucidate the need for specific precompetition training loads and/or between-matches/sessions recovery strategies when facing overloaded competitions. © 2019 Human Kinetics, Inc.",10.1123/ijspp.2018-0234,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85071436410&doi=10.1123%2fijspp.2018-0234&partnerID=40&md5=ce2843b07cff34c05ec6a4b22f8dcf2d,SCOPUS,No,No se pueden realizar apuestas en jugadores menores.

Miguel,The professionalization of international tennis referees from the 1960s to the present day: between individual French initiatives and institutionalization by federal organization; [La professionnalisation des arbitres internationaux de tennis des années 1960 à nos jours: entre initiatives françaises individuelles et institutionnalisation par les instances fédérales],"The refereeing ecosystem remains unexplored and little investigated, particularly in the tennis world, in which officials have long remained passionate amateurs in the shadows. However, the analysis of the specialized press and the rare works written by the interested themselves, coupled with semi-directive interviews carried out with former and current international umpires allows us to historically glimpse the structuring of this environment, in parallel with increase in economic and media issues brought by the entry into the Open era in 1968. We then observed the arrival of international badges in 1979 including French officials like Patrick Flodrops and Michel Perrot will be among the first winners, helping to establish a hierarchy in an environment which will become professional, as demonstrated by the pioneering career of Bruno Rebeuh with the International Tennis Federation (ITF). Since then and in the wake of massification of international events, organized by the ITF, the ATP and the WTA which now govern tennis throughout the world, the number of French officials on the international stage has exploded since the 1990s to structure itself even further and professionalize itself in the 2000s from the federal level in such a way as to definitively establish a claimed French domination. © ACAPS, 2024.; L’écosystème arbitral demeure inexploré et peu investigué, notamment dans le milieu tennistique, au sein duquel les officiels sont longtemps restés des amateurs passionnés de l’ombre. Pourtant, l’analyse de la presse spécialisée et des rares ouvrages rédigés par les intéressés eux-mêmes, couplée à des entretiens semi-directifs réalisés auprès d’anciens et d’actuels arbitres internationaux nous permet d’entrevoir historiquement la structuration de ce milieu parallèlement à l’augmentation des enjeux économiques et médiatiques apportés par l’entrée dans l’ère Open en 1968. Nous observons alors l’arrivée de badges internationaux dans en 1979 dont certains officiels français à l’instar de Patrick Flodrops et de Michel Perrot seront parmi les premiers lauréats, contribuant à hiérarchiser un milieu qui se professionnalisera ensuite comme l’expose la carrière annonciatrice de Bruno Rebeuh auprès de la fédération internationale de tennis (ITF). Depuis et dans le sillage d’une massification des évènements internationaux organisés par l’ITF, l’ATP et la WTA qui dirigent désormais le tennis dans le monde entier, le nombre d’officiels français sur l’échiquier international explose dès les années 1990 pour se structurer davantage encore et se professionnaliser dans les années 2000 dès l’échelle fédérale de telle sorte à asseoir définitivement une domination française revendiquée. © 2024 EDP Sciences.

Miguel,Pre- and post-competitive anxiety and match outcome in elite international junior tennis players,"This study aimed to analyse the impact of match outcome (win or lose) in an elite international tennis competition on pre-competitive anxiety and self-confidence. A cohort of Under-16 elite boys (n = 18), with a mean age of 15.44 (0.616) years and an international competitive experience of 4.44 (1.89) years, which were representing six national teams participated in this cross-sectional study. The assessments took part in a qualifying stage of the International Tennis Federation (ITF) Junior Davis Cup competition. During the tournament, participants played the best of three set matches. The Competitive State Anxiety Inventory – 2R (CSAI-2R) and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-E) were employed to assess the pre-competitive anxiety before and after the tournament's match. Cognitive and somatic anxiety were slightly higher before than after the matches. No significant differences were found between the pre-and post-match measures. However, significant differences in cognitive anxiety, state anxiety and self-confidence were found when comparing pre-match and post-match values between winners and losers. In this regard, winners showed a significant reduction in state anxiety and cognitive anxiety after the match. According to our results, intervention programmes should incorporate tools that will assist players in their management of anxiety and self-confidence, specifically with those players who lost the match. © The Author(s) 2022.",10.1177/17479541221122396,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85136823887&doi=10.1177%2f17479541221122396&partnerID=40&md5=c68ad2dcc3bd662ba98676940d9aed48,SCOPUS,No,No se pueden realizar apuestas en jugadores menores.

Miguel,A peculiar phenomenon and its potential explanation in the ATP tennis tour finals for singles,"The ATP finals is the concluding tournament of the tennis season since its initiation over 50 years ago. It features the 8 best players of that year and is often considered to be the most prestigious event in the sport other than the 4 grand slams. Unlike any other professional tennis tournament, it includes a round-robin stage where all players in a group compete against each other, making it a unique testbed for examining performance under forgiving conditions, where losing does not immediately result in elimination. Analysis of the distribution of final group standings in the ATP Finals for singles from 1972 to 2021 reveals a surprising pattern, where one of the possible and seemingly likely outcomes almost never materializes. The present study uses a model-free, optimization approach to account for this distinctive phenomenon by calculating what match winning probabilities between players in a group can lead to the observed distribution. Results show that the only way to explain the empirical findings is through a ""paradoxical""balance of power where the best player in a group shows a vulnerability against the weakest player. We discuss the possible mechanisms underlying this result and their implications for match prediction, bettors, and tournament organization. © 2023 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.",10.1515/jqas-2022-0043,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85146522965&doi=10.1515%2fjqas-2022-0043&partnerID=40&md5=a80989ab5a4a1d5f7dcddc33faf26144,SCOPUS,No,"Simula un escenario de enfrentamiento de jugadores entre jugadores, con el objetivo de evaluar el rendimiento en cada uno de los partidos y como pueden influir al resto.

Miguel,Analysis of Technical–Tactical Actions in High-Level Table Tennis Players: Differences between Sexes,"Table tennis is a sport played at a high speed; therefore, the technical–tactical variables are very important. The objective of the research is to analyze the technical and tactical characteristics of high-level TT players according to sex. A total of 48 high-level players (24 women and 24 men) participated in the present study. The investigation was carried out during two championships. The matches were recorded and subsequently analyzed by notational analysis. The results indicate that women stroke the ball more times during the rallies. In the men’s competition, the forehand technique predominates over the backhand technique. The flip was the most used in the male sex (p < 0.05). At the tactical level, more winning actions were performed in the men’s competition than in the women’s, both with the forehand and backhand game. Men performed more losing technical actions when using the forehand and backhand flips. The pivot footwork tactical action was higher in the men’s competition. The analysis of the technical–tactical actions highlighted important differences between the sexes. The predominant losing techniques among players are forehand and backhand flip. Female players use more defensive strokes, while male players use more offensive strokes, in particular the flip technique. The potential biomechanical progress of the male player characterized by a larger wingspan biotype could facilitate a better technical–tactical performance. The results obtained are of interest to improve the performance of the players as they must train at a technical–tactical level differently depending on the sex and style of play. © 2023 by the authors.",10.3390/sports11110225,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85178274544&doi=10.3390%2fsports11110225&partnerID=40&md5=10a174edfcb382ed27d722ec064a7466,SCOPUS,No,Estudio de características a fortalecer o a considerar por los difertentes deportistas.

Miguel,Re-establishing Fetch-Directed Instruction Prefetching: An Industry Perspective,"Instruction prefetching can play a pivotal role in improving the performance of workloads with large instruction footprints and frequent, costly frontend stalls. In particular, Fetch Directed Prefetching (FDP) is an effective technique to mitigate frontend stalls since it leverages existing branch prediction resources in a processor and incurs very little hardware overhead. Modern processors have been trending towards provisioning more frontend resources, which bodes well for FDP as it requires these resources to be effective. However, recent academic research has been using outdated and less than optimal frontend baselines that employ smaller structures, resulting in equivocal outcomes. This paper presents a detailed FDP microarchitecture and evaluates two improvements, better branch history management and post-fetch correction. Our mechanism provides a 41.0% speedup over the baseline (no prefetching, no FDP) with only 195 bytes of hardware overhead and outperforms the 1st Instruction Prefetching Championship (IPC-1) winners that had a 128KB storage budget. We believe that our FDP-based frontend design can serve as a new reference baseline for instruction prefetching research to bridge the gap between academia and industry.  © 2021 IEEE.",10.1109/ISPASS51385.2021.00034,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85105415390&doi=10.1109%2fISPASS51385.2021.00034&partnerID=40&md5=ef254f37341467618e45fb5f06799f87,SCOPUS,No,Fuera del tema completamente,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The sports analytics field can help teams in gaining a competitive advantage by analyzing historical data and formulating strategies and making data driven decisions regarding game plans, play selection and player recruitment. This work focuses on the application of sports analytics in the National Football League. We compare the classification performance of several methods (C4.5, Neural Network and Random Forest) in classifying the winner of the Superbowl using data collected during the regular season. We split the data into a training set and test set and use the synthetic minority oversampling technique to address the data imbalance issue in the training set. The classification performance is compared on the test set using several measures. According to the findings, the Random Forest classifier had the highest recall, AUC, accuracy and specificity as the oversampling percentage was increased.

Miguel,Does certainty on the winner diminish the interest in sport competitions? The case of formula one,"The literature acknowledges “Uncertainty of Outcome” (UO) as a major factor to explain the degree of interest that sporting competitions draw from fans and the general public. Uncertainty about the championship winner is crucial insofar as financial success depends on the capacity to attract potential consumers of spectacle. This paper focusses on one aspect of UO and examines to what extent reduction in the interest of followers is due to the removal of uncertainty about the world drivers’ champion in Formula One. To study how certainty on the winner undermines the degree of attention generated by the Formula One world drivers’ championship, we rely on two alternative indexes—similar although not identical—reported by Google Trends. Both of these appraisals are computed from data on users’ search intensity in Google, where weekly records are normalised on the relative amount of searches per calendar year. Thus, as dependent variables for the empirical analysis we use two measures: Google Trends News (GTN), to capture the intensity with which individuals search news articles associated; and Google Trends Web (GTW), to get a wider overview based on all kind of Internet contents. The former empirical analysis is carried out on 10 years of available data, while the latter approach estimates the models for a larger period of 14 years. Our empirical strategy includes additionally adopting indicator saturation techniques to address this issue while controlling for outliers. © 2021, The Author(s).",10.1007/s00181-021-02147-8,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85116999638&doi=10.1007%2fs00181-021-02147-8&partnerID=40&md5=4853834b271f7654841d88aa7ea3a819,SCOPUS,No,Centrado en temas sociológicos y comportamiento humano,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The model was constructed by data collected from a social network where fans of a soccer team periodically expressed feelings towards their team. We show that the choice of a HMM is justified due to the fact that the change in a fan's sentiment is analogous to a Markovian process of change of state through time. A comparative evaluation will be performed between variations of the proposed models and also between the most accurate of them and classification algorithms.

Miguel,Examining the frequency and nature of gambling marketing in televised broadcasts of professional sporting events in the United Kingdom,"Objective: Gambling operators in the United Kingdom have introduced a voluntary ban on adverts broadcast during televised sport before 21:00 (the ‘whistle-to-whistle’ ban). To inform debates around the potential effectiveness of this ban, we examine the frequency and nature of gambling marketing in televised broadcasts across professional sporting events. Study design: Frequency analysis of verbal and visual gambling marketing references during television broadcasts of football (n = 5), tennis, Formula 1, boxing and rugby union (each n = 1) from 2018. Methods: For each gambling reference, we coded: whether it appeared in-play or out-of-play; location (e.g. pitch-side advertising); format (e.g. branded merchandise); duration (s); number of identical references visible simultaneously; brand; and presence of age restriction or harm-reduction messages. Results: Boxing contained the most gambling references, on average, per broadcast minute (4.70 references), followed by football (2.75), rugby union (0.55) and tennis (0.11). Formula 1 contained no gambling references. In boxing, references most frequently appeared within the area-of-play. For football and rugby union, references most frequently appeared around the pitch border or within the area-of-play (e.g. branded shirts). Only a small minority of references were for adverts during commercial breaks that would be subject to the whistle-to-whistle ban (e.g. 2% of references in football). Less than 1% of references in boxing and only 3% of references in football contained age restriction or harm-reduction messages. Conclusions: As gambling sponsorship extends much beyond adverts in commercial breaks, the ‘whistle-to-whistle’ ban will have limited effect on gambling exposure. Gambling sponsorship activities rarely contain harm-reduction messages. © 2020",10.1016/j.puhe.2020.02.012,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85082648420&doi=10.1016%2fj.puhe.2020.02.012&partnerID=40&md5=cac02403ddabea9db0b013cd5be27686,SCOPUS,No,Anuncios en las televisiones sobre las apuestas.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Miguel,Data Mining Computing of Predicting NBA 2019–2020 Regular Season MVP Winner,"This project is to build statistical models to decide which players should win the NBA 2019-2020 regular season Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award. Top 50 potential candidates were selected to enter the 2019-2020 MVP race. Prior building the MVP models, the player statistics data has been Z-standardized to remove any mean and standard deviation bias. The “Uniform MVP Index” has been derived from combining each player's Z statistics with equal weight. Team has further derived a “Weighted and Subset” model by adding the weight factor and the best subset feature selection. Authors have added the “Team Winning” factor in the Power Model from power= 0 (equivalent to the Weighted Model), 0.5,1,1.5 to power= infinity (MVP from the best Team).

Miguel,The football championship is won when playing away: difference in match statistics between the winner and the second-place team in LaLiga,"The aim of this study was to identify match statistics that best explained the differences between the first- and the second-placed teams in the Spanish National football championship (LaLiga). For this aim, the number of wins, draws, losses, distribution of scored/received goals, and accumulated attack, and defensive match statistics were obtained of the 1st and 2nd place teams for eight seasons (from 2010–2011 to 2017–2018). In comparison to the championship winner, the second-place team obtained a similar number of victories at home but a lower number of away wins (effect size [ES] = moderate). The goal-based variables with the highest effect size between the first- and second-place teams were a higher number of goals scored while playing away and a lower number of goals received while playing away (ES = moderate). A higher shooting accuracy along with less conceded shots and conceded corners (ES = moderate), were the match statistics with the highest effect size between the investigated teams. A higher number of wins when playing away was the best indicator of performance to differentiate between the championship winner and the second-place team. Increased shooting accuracy and conceding less shots from corners might also aid in obtaining victory in LaLiga. © 2020 Cardiff Metropolitan University.",10.1080/24748668.2020.1801201,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089173014&doi=10.1080%2f24748668.2020.1801201&partnerID=40&md5=059f00d7d615d5e39cddcafaf0097b41,SCOPUS,No,Se realiza un análisis sobre estadísticas y datos de los que disponemos con el fin de obtener conclusiones sobre la importancia de jugar fuera de casa.

Miguel,Analysis of throwing performance in elite women's beach handball,"The objective of this study was to ascertain the differences in throwing performance between winning and losing elite female beach handball teams. An observational methodology was used, and an ad hoc instrument was created for data collection. The sample consisted of 2,160 throws in 38 matches of the Women's Senior Beach Handball World Championships in Kazan in 2018. The results showed significant differences in the number of goals, goalkeeper saves and blocking between winners and losers (p<0.01). Spectacular throws were more numerous than simple throws. The spin shot was the resource most utilised by both winners and losers, although there were significant performance differences in favour of the winners (p<0.01). The winning teams executed a greater number of in-flight shots (p<0.01), more effectively and scoring a greater number of points (p<0.01) with this type of shot. © Copyright Generalitat de Catalunya (INEFC).

Miguel,Match-fixing under the state monopoly sports betting system: a case study of the 2011 K-League scandal,"This paper examines the characteristics of match-fixing under the state monopoly sports betting system, particularly focusing on the case of the 2011 K-League scandal. Drawing from policy documentation and interview data, this study explores the precipitating factors that underpin large-scale match-fixing in South Korea. The results of the analysis reveal that first, the financial stability of the legal, monopoly betting operator attracts match-fixers for manipulation due to its guaranteed payouts. Second, the legal betting system that only offers traditional products (e.g., final match results) required fixers to mobilize a larger number of players, increasing the size of the scandal. Third, within the small community of footballers, the networks based on school ties, and the training camp culture made it easier for fixers with soccer-playing backgrounds to mobilize many active players. Finally, the follow-up measures after the scandal only targeted illegal betting operators or individual player immorality, which allowed the government to continue to play a dual role as both the operator of the sports gambling business and the protector of sport integrity. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.",10.1007/s10611-020-09888-0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85079519251&doi=10.1007%2fs10611-020-09888-0&partnerID=40&md5=98510f7de2e32532e20b625f1a045357,SCOPUS,No,Análisis sobre un escándalo de amaño en las apuestas deportivas,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Miguel,Analysis of changes in heart rate variability before and after a table tennis match depending on the outcome,"The aim of this study was to compare heart rate variability (HRV) indices before and after a table tennis match, depending in match result. HRV indices were measured before (PRE) and after (POST) match periods to 21 table tennis players (21.86 ± 8.34 yr) in 30 matches. No significant differences were found neither in PRE nor in POST measures comparing winners and losers. A significantly lower value (p < 0.05) was found in mean of RR intervals (mean RR), standard deviation of RR intervals (SDNN), the natural logarithm transform of the root mean square of successive differences between normal heartbeats (LnRMSSD), relative number of successive RR interval pairs that differ more than 50 ms (pNN50), cross (SD1) and longitudinal (SD2) axis of Poincaré plot comparing POST values with PRE values. Nevertheless, low frequency index expressed in absolute power (LF Power) and high frequency indices expressed in absolute power (HF power) and normalised power (HF Power) showed different trends depending on the results (p < 0.05). The obtained results show a HRV decrease after table tennis match regardless the match result, in both time domain and non-linear indices. However, frequency domain indices show a different trend depending on the match outcome. © 2022 Archivos de Medicina del Deporte.

Miguel,Win or lose. Physical and physiological responses in paddle tennis competition according to the game result,"Sports success can be determined by technical level, physical condition, but also with behaviour and decision-making in competition. The main aim of this study was to compare the different physiological and physical responses of professional male paddle-tennis players as a function of the game result. Sixty sets and twenty-four players were analysed in the Spanish National Championships. Heart rate (HR), lactate concentrations, rating of perceived exertion (RPE), covered distance and speed and sprints were measured. Comparative tests were performed to compare winners and losers, and RPE was analysed using the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve test through Logit model. Losers showed greater results in the mean HR (154.1±15.6 beats·min−1) than winners (144.2±19.1 beats·min−1, p<0.01). A score of 6–10 or 16–20 points in RPE, entailed a high or low probability of winning the set (72–92% or 6–23%, respectively). Physical responses were higher in losers, e.g. higher distances, mean velocity, sprints number between 2.1–9.0 km·h−1. As conclusions, players who finally lose the match demand greater physical and physiological responses in general. It is established, as in other racket sports, that the player’s position on the court is key to determining victory in this sport. © 2022 Cardiff Metropolitan University.",10.1080/24748668.2022.2082173,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85131156830&doi=10.1080%2f24748668.2022.2082173&partnerID=40&md5=d776f52ae143fc0faa2c69f19b8dceaa,SCOPUS,No,"Útil a la hora de obtener conclusiones pero no es una característica relvante a la hora de predecir un resultado de un partido.

Miguel,Clustering tennis players’ anthropometric and individual features helps to reveal performance fingerprints,"The study was aimed to explore distinct players’ groups according to their anthropometric and individual features, and to identify the key performance indicators that discriminate player groups. Match statistics, anthropometric and personal features of 1188 male players competing during 2015–2017 main draw Grand Slam singles events were collected. Height, weight, experience, handedness and backhand style were used to automatically classify players into different clusters through unsupervised learning model. Afterwards, 29 match variables were analysed through MANOVA and discriminant analysis in order to evaluate the different match performance among player groups and to identify the key performance indicators that best differentiate player clusters in each Grand Slam. The analysis revealed the existence of four clusters, they were classified as Big-sized Right Two-handed Players (n = 387), Medium-sized Right One-handed Players (n = 265), Small-sized Right Two-handed Players (n = 414), and Left Two-handed Players (n = 122). Serve, winner, net and physical performance-related indicators (Structure Coefficient ≥ |0.30|) were showed to be the maximum contributors to the group separation. Left-handed players were the most homogenous group in performance. Taller players outperformed their peers in all Slams except for Roland Garros, where left-handed players demonstrated certain advantage playing on slow-pace surface. In Wimbledon and US Open, Medium-sized Right One-handed Players showed better net and physical performance. The advantage of left-handed player is over-represented at elite level. Current findings promote a better understanding of match-play from distinct player groups and offer information on evaluating contextual variability for achieving better performances. © 2019, © 2019 European College of Sport Science.",10.1080/17461391.2019.1577494,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85068717795&doi=10.1080%2f17461391.2019.1577494&partnerID=40&md5=35a9b5b778d29c3b2d75a313ddf23b5d,SCOPUS,No,Útil a la hora de obtener estadísticas interesantes pero no es determinante a la hora de realizar una predicción en el resultado,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Miguel,The Grayness of Match-Fixing: A Study of the Prevalence and Sanctionability of Non-Betting-Related Match-Fixing in Football and Tennis,"In this study, we provide a nuanced perspective on a sub-type of match-fixing, called non-betting-related match-fixing (NBMF). Using a cross-sectional survey, we measured the prevalence and motives behind NBMF in Belgian amateur football and tennis. Additionally, we conducted a thorough study of the regulatory documents of the relevant (sports) organizations to examine the sanctionability of different types of NBMF by analyzing their disciplinary regulations surrounding NBMF and, if applicable, their sanctioning guidelines. Furthermore, various instances of NBMF were applied to the definition of competition manipulation of the Council of Europe’s Macolin Convention. We conclude that NBMF is not always linked to sporting outcomes and that the gray zone that surrounds it differs between both sports depending on the specificity of their regulations, and the subjectivity with which they are implemented in practice. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",10.1080/01639625.2024.2364279,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85195485868&doi=10.1080%2f01639625.2024.2364279&partnerID=40&md5=cbc0268ceb81fa176533351256e6b4ed,SCOPUS,No,"Este estudio analiza el amaño de partidos no relacionado con apuestas (NBMF) en el fútbol y tenis amateur en Bélgica, evaluando su prevalencia, motivaciones y regulación, concluyendo que su impacto varía según el deporte y la aplicación de las normativas.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Miguel,The paradox of talent: How chance affects success in tennis tournaments,"Individual sports competitions provide a natural setting for examining the relative importance of talent and luck/chance in achieving success. The belief that success is primarily due to individual abilities and hard work rather than external factors is particularly strong in this context. Thus, individual talent is regarded as the most important – if not the only – component in ensuring a successful career for athletes. In this study, we test this belief using tennis as a case study, due to its popularity and competition structure in direct-elimination tournaments. Our dataset covers the last decade before Covid-19 pandemics (2010–2019) of main international events in the ATP circuit and consists of tourney results and annual rankings for professional male players. After a preliminary data analysis, we introduce an agent-based model able to accurately simulate the tennis players’ dynamics along several seasons. We show that, once calibrated on the dataset, the model is able to reproduce the main stylized facts observed in real data, including the results of single tournaments and the development of players’ careers in the ATP community. The strength of our approach lies in its simplicity: it requires only one free parameter a to determine the importance of talent in scoring every single point: a=1 indicates the ideal scenario in which only talent matters, whereas a=0 represents the opposite limit case, in which the outcome of each point is entirely due to chance. We find the best agreement between real data and simulation results when talent weights substantially less than luck, i.e. when a is between 0.20 and 0.30. A further comparison between data and simulations, based on the analysis of the direct networks of all the matches, confirms the previous finding. A posteriori, we notice that this surprisingly important role of chance in tennis tournaments is not an exception. On the contrary, it can be explained by a more general paradoxical effect that characterizes highly competitive environments, particularly in individual sports. In other words, when the difference in talent between top players is minimal, chance becomes determinant. Our findings highlight the impact of the – too often underestimated – external factors on athletes’ performance in individual tournaments and their careers. Our results point out the unfairness of the “winner-takes-all” reward system that enhances the disparities between the first classified players and the others in major competitions. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.chaos.2023.114088,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85173537901&doi=10.1016%2fj.chaos.2023.114088&partnerID=40&md5=cbc47250cf1f5a10cf958dc9f1a8e97a,SCOPUS,No,"Este estudio analiza el impacto del talento y la suerte en el éxito deportivo usando el tenis como caso de estudio, mostrando que en entornos altamente competitivos la suerte pesa más de lo esperado, cuestionando la equidad del sistema de recompensas.

,Match statistics significant to win the initial and intense rounds of a tennis tournament,"This paper analyses the initial and intense rounds of the 2020 Australian Open Men’s Singles matches on 14 match statistics. The findings show that the statistics which are important to winning in the initial rounds are not the same as those for winning in the intense rounds. In the initial rounds, the match winner performed better than the loser on receiving points won, second serve to win, first serve to win, breakpoints won, net points won, winners, total points won, unforced errors, aces, double faults, fastest serve speed, and average first-serve speed. However, to win the intense rounds, the winner performed better than the loser on first serve to win, receiving points won and net points won. The findings help the player and the coach to develop skills and techniques to devise a player strategy during the initial rounds and the intense rounds to win the tournament. © 2020, University School of Physical Education.

,Hidden Power of Trading Activity: The FLB in Tennis Betting Exchanges,"This article examines the impact of trading activity on the favorite–long shot bias (FLB) in tennis betting exchanges, using direct measures such as betting volume, average bet, and standard deviation of the odds. According to predictions based on disagreement models, odds mispricing is positively associated with trading volume but negatively associated with the presence of institutional bettors. The FLB is also positively related to the degree of uncertainty in the market. The existence of two simultaneous markets (a “main” and an “alternative” market) in this specific sports-betting environment has enabled us to observe that the relative amount of attention given to the favorite versus that given to the long shot is positively associated with the FLB. Finally, information is more rapidly incorporated into the odds in the market that receives more attention from bettors, an effect that is intensified by the arbitrage and hedging that occurs between the two markets. © The Author(s) 2017.",10.1177/1527002517731875,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85059587901&doi=10.1177%2f1527002517731875&partnerID=40&md5=42beda16a12751b82a0fe6fa99298dd2,SCOPUS,Si,,Standard Desviation,Analisis Estadistico,Tenis,APT Tour,masculino,No,Se excluyeron partidos con baja liquidez,24683 partidos,"volumen de apuestas, promedio de apuesta, número de cuotas diferentes, desviación estándar de cuotas, probabilidad implícita y tipos de eventos",privado,-------------,Analizar la influencia de la actividad de trading en la fijación de precios en mercados de apuestas de tenis,Sesgo en la fijación,"Se encontró que el FLB es mayor en eventos con alto volumen de apuestas y atención en el favorito, mientras que disminuye en eventos con mayor proporción de apostadores institucionales",Betfair,"2003/04, 2012/13","Isabel Abínzano, Luis Muga, Rafael Santamaría",,"Los datos provienen solo de Betfair, lo que limita la generalización a otros mercados de apuestas."
,Weighted Elo rating for tennis match predictions,"Originally applied to tennis by the data journalists of FiveThirtyEight.com, the Elo rating method estimates the strength of each player based on her/his career as well as the outcome of the last match played. Together with the regression-based, point-based and paired-comparison approaches, the Elo rating is a popular method to predict the probability of winning tennis matches. Notwithstanding its widely recognized merits in terms of ease of reproducibility and good performance, the Elo method does not completely take into account the current form of each player and their recent performances. This paper proposes a new version of the Elo rating method, labelled Weighted Elo (WElo), where the standard Elo updating is additionally weighted according to the scoreline of the players’ last match. The proposed method considers not only if a player has won (lost) a match, but also how the victory (defeat) was achieved. In the empirical application, the forecasting performance of the WElo method is evaluated and compared against the most popular forecasting methods in tennis, using a sample of over 60,000 men's and women's professional matches. Overall, the WElo method outperforms all these competing methods. Moreover, it provides meaningfully profitable opportunities, according to a simple betting strategy. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",10.1016/j.ejor.2021.04.011,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85106890945&doi=10.1016%2fj.ejor.2021.04.011&partnerID=40&md5=54bc6f079d5f017ced06d167a6990528,SCOPUS,Si,,"Accuracy, Brier Score",Logistic Regression,Tenis,APT Tour,masculino,No,"Limpieza de datos, eliminación de partidos incompletos, normalización de probabilidades implícitas en apuestas.",60000 partidos,"Resultados de partidos, número de juegos y sets ganados por cada jugador, cuotas de apuestas, ranking ATP/WTA, ATP points, cierre de apuestas de múltiples casas de apuestas.",público,https://www.tennis-data.co.uk/,Mejorar la precisión de predicción de partidos de tenis incorporando información del desempeño reciente en la actualización del rating Elo.,Victoria o Derrota,El método Weighted Elo (WElo) supera a los modelos estándar en precisión de predicción y rentabilidad en apuestas.,https://www.tennis-data.co.uk/,"2005/06, 2019/20","Giovanni Angelini, Vincenzo Candila, Luca De Angelis",,"Se enfoca solo en los principales torneos profesionales, lo que podría generar sesgo al no incluir competiciones menores."
,Subsampled Dataset Challenges and Machine Learning Techniques in Table Tennis,"Artificial Intelligence has been widely used almost in every aspect of our lives, and sports activity is no exception. In that field, table tennis is a very demanding sport, in which predicting the winner of a point or a match can be quite challenging. This paper explores the application of several machine learning algorithms in subsampled table tennis data. Especially, the Multilayer Perceptrons, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosted Trees have been used in order to predict the result of individual points and matches. The algorithms were trained on real data from official First Division matches of the Hellenic Table Tennis Federation. The Gradient Boosted Trees achieved the highest level of accuracy (98.36%) in the prediction of each individual point and (74.92%) in the prediction of the winner of the match. The 98.36% accuracy is very high, while the 74.92% is affordable, because the match winner could have won even fewer points than its opponent. Also, Gradient Boosted Trees achieved the less computational time, making it suitable for use in real-time systems to assist tactical coaching in table tennis. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",10.1007/978-3-031-34204-2_44,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85164034605&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-031-34204-2_44&partnerID=40&md5=d9a1fc9c167de2f17c3ed7fdfe0de6de,SCOPUS,Si,,"Accuracy, MAE, RMSE",Random Forest,Tenis de Mesa,Liga griega,masculino,No,-----------,64 partidos,"servicio, posición del jugador, ranking, tipo de golpe, área de servicio, número de golpes por punto, resultado del punto",privado,-------------,Predecir el resultado de cada punto individual y el ganador del partido en función de las características del juego,Victoria o Derrota,modelo Gradient Boosted Trees obtuvo los mejores resultados con una precisión del 98.36% para la predicción de cada punto y del 74.92% para la predicción del ganador del partido,Primera División de la Federación Helénica de Tenis de Mesa,2019/20,"Dimitrios Simopoulos, Andreas Nikolakakis, George Anastassopoulos",,El dataset es pequeño y solo incluye partidos de una liga específica

The new procedure is especially germane for matches in which there is a heavy favorite and where there is concern that traditional conversion methods understate the true probability of the favorite winning.

,Psychological pressure and compounded errors during elite-level tennis,"Objectives: In the context of Grand Slam tennis, we sought to examine how situational pressure and prior errors can disrupt subsequent performance in elite performers. Methods: A retrospective analysis of more than 650,000 points across 12 Grand Slam tennis tournaments from 2016 to 2019 was conducted to identify pressurised in-game moments and unforced errors. A scoring system was used to index situational pressure based on the current match situation (e.g., break points, stage of the match) on a point-by-point basis. The occurrence of performance errors was identified based on double faults and unforced errors, as instances of controllable mistakes. Results: A mixed effects logistic regression model revealed that an increase in the pressure index (a 1–5 score) significantly increased the probability of a performance error (ps <.001), as did an error on the preceding point (OR = 1.2, 95%CI [1.17, 1.23], p <.001). A multiplicative effect of pressure and prior errors also emerged, as the negative impact of prior errors on performance was greater when situational pressure was already high, in line with the predictions of Attentional Control Theory: Sport (ACTS). Analyses of the distribution of winners and unforced errors across individual players revealed that winning players were as susceptible to pressure and prior errors as losing players. Conclusions: These findings extend our understanding of how ongoing feedback from prior mistakes may further exacerbate the effects of pressure on performance. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.psychsport.2021.101987,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85106507295&doi=10.1016%2fj.psychsport.2021.101987&partnerID=40&md5=0e801e1e55203a095eafd52dcd7e08d6,SCOPUS,Si,,Odds Ratio,Logistic Regression,Tenis,Grand Slam,masculino,No,"Limpieza de datos, asignación de índices de presión basados en el estado del partido, identificación de errores no forzados y doble faltas.",3552 partidos,"puntos jugados, estado del partido (sets, juegos), quién servía, ganador del punto, break points, doble faltas, errores no forzados, winners",público,https://osf.io/b4vpd/ y https://github.com/JeffSackmann/tennis_slam_pointbypoint,Analizar cómo la presión psicológica y errores previos afectan la probabilidad de cometer errores en tenis de alto nivel.,Performance Statistics,Se encontró que la presión aumenta la probabilidad de errores no forzados y que los errores previos incrementan la posibilidad de cometer otro error en el siguiente punto,Sitios web de los torneos de Grand Slam,"2016/17, 2018/19","David J.

,Tennis at tiebreaks: addressing elite players’ performance for tomorrows’ coaching; [Tennis bei Tiebreaks: Wie zukünftiges Coaching von Profis lernen kann],"The tiebreak in tennis is one of the most-contested situations during a set. Often the outcome of a tiebreak is trendsetting for the match. Thus, every point in a tiebreak may be defined as a “big point”, and only the best players are able to play their best tennis. However, differences in players’ performances between tiebreak points (TBP) and non-tiebreak points (NTBP) remain to be elucidated. Therefore, this study aimed to compare players’ performance at TBP and NTBP. For this, the rally length, serve and return behaviour, as well as the number of winners and forced and unforced errors for male players in the Wimbledon tournament 2016 were examined to determine possible impacts of a supposable mental stress in the tiebreak situation. A total of 28,570 points were analysed and divided into TBP (n = 1039) and NTBP (n = 27,531). It was shown that rally length increases subsequent to the first serve (p < 0.1; 3.27 to 3.70 shots) and that players produce less unforced errors at tiebreaks (p < 0.1; 23.50 to 20.60%). Further research may investigate a potential impact of these findings on winning or losing a tiebreak, eventually indicating future practice patterns that explicitly consider mental skills situations. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Deutschland, ein Teil von Springer Nature.",10.1007/s12662-019-00611-3,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85071787875&doi=10.1007%2fs12662-019-00611-3&partnerID=40&md5=618cbdfb61fd579efa9b5e88bbf5a59d,SCOPUS,Si,,T tests,Analisis Estadistico,Tenis,Grand Slam,masculino,No,-------------,126 partidos,"Datos de rendimiento en puntos de tiebreaks y no tiebreaks, incluyendo longitud del rally, errores no forzados, errores forzados, winners, aces, doble faltas y porcentaje de primeros y segundos servicios ganados",privado,--------------,Analizar cómo los jugadores de élite rinden en puntos de tiebreaks comparados con puntos normales,Performance Statistics,Se encontró que los jugadores aumentan la longitud del rally en tiebreaks y cometen menos errores no forzados,IBM y estadísticas de Wimbledon,2016/17,"Dominik Meffert, Craig O’Shannessy, Philipp Born, Ralph Grambow, Tobias Vogt",,no se incluyen factores psicológicos o físicos que podrían influir en el rendimiento en tiebreaks
,A Study of Tennis Momentum Factors Based on BP Neural Networks and Multiple Regression Models,"Owing to the intricate nature of the tennis program, pinpointing just one determinant to elucidate the game's outcomes effectively is challenging, necessitating a broader and more cohesive evaluation. This paper choses data from the 2023 Wimbledon men's final to measure the influence of various elements on the game's result, including the players' performance in the match, their personal standing, and the actual conditions. The relative importance of momentum, the validity of the model, and the importance of individual predictors were assessed based on a neural network. At the same time, the relevant factors affecting the winners and losers of the matches are analyzed as a reference for whether the players can win the matches and how the coaches set up their strategies during the matches.  © 2024 IEEE.",10.1109/ICIPCA61593.2024.10709116,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85207950358&doi=10.1109%2fICIPCA61593.2024.10709116&partnerID=40&md5=c5dbf92a519f1597c3e751971da8936c,SCOPUS,Si,,Accuracy,Red Neuronal,Tenis,Grand Slam,masculino,No,-------------,Conjunto de datos basado en los partidos del año 2023,"momentum en partidos, número de juegos ganados, tasa de errores no forzados, distancia recorrida, velocidad del saque, número de golpes por punto, si el jugador está sirviendo o no",privado,--------------,Analizar cómo los factores de momentum afectan el desempeño de los jugadores y predecir cambios en la dinámica del partido,Performance Statistics,Se encontró una alta correlación entre cambios en el momentum y los resultados de los puntos,Wimbledon 2023,2023/24,"Yutong Wei, Miaomiao Yang, Yulin Gao",,El estudio se basa en datos de pocos partidos y se enfoca en la final de Wimbledon 2023
,Neural networks and betting strategies for tennis,"Recently, the interest of the academic literature on sports statistics has increased enormously. In such a framework, two of the most significant challenges are developing a model able to beat the existing approaches and, within a betting market framework, guarantee superior returns than the set of competing specifications considered. This contribution attempts to achieve both these results, in the context of male tennis. In tennis, several approaches to predict the winner are available, among which the regression-based, point-based and paired comparison of the competitors’ abilities play a significant role. Contrary to the existing approaches, this contribution employs artificial neural networks (ANNs) to forecast the probability of winning in tennis matches, starting from all the variables used in a large selection of the previous methods. From an out-of-sample perspective, the implemented ANN model outperforms four out of five competing models, independently of the considered period. For what concerns the betting perspective, we propose four different strategies. The resulting returns on investment obtained from the ANN appear to be more broad and robust than those obtained from the best competing model, irrespective of the betting strategy adopted. © 2020 by the authors.

,Modelling the scores and performance statistics of NBA basketball games,"This paper investigates the problem of modeling and forecasting the outcomes of NBA basketball games based on performance statistics. A bivariate normal mean regression model is developed to model the scores and performance statistics. Two methods for forecasting the performance statistics ex ante are proposed in order to predict the outcomes of NBA basketball games, including the final scores of two teams and the probability that a specific team wins the game. Besides, a betting strategy is developed and efficiency tests in the handicap betting market are conducted.

,Predicting Winner of Football Match Using Analytical Hierarchy Process: An Analysis Based on Previous Matches Data,"Football as the most popular and most interesting sport in the world has applied the technology to obtain more match data easily. Data analysis in football matches can be used to find out how the match is going and even to predict the winner of a match. This paper proposes the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) method to predict the winners of soccer matches that can finally predict the champion of a tournament. For one team, six factors and 13 alternative values are applied to AHP method to get the final score that can be compared to the opponent’s final score in a match. To evaluate the proposal, matches in UEFA Champions League 2018 are simulated. Based on the results, the method can give correct predictions on 13 matches, which means the effectiveness of the applied method is 86.67%.

Rafadom,Do Politically Irrelevant Events Cause Conflict? The Cross-continental Effects of European Professional Football on Protests in Africa,"We examine whether politically irrelevant events can cause conflicts, by analyzing the effects of professional football games in Europe on protests in Africa - an unintended spillover across the continents. By expanding psychological theories, we argue that the outcomes of the football games in Europe can affect African people's subjective evaluation of domestic politicians, which in turn can trigger protests. By exploiting as-if random variation in the results of 15,102 close football games conditional on betting odds, we find that compared to draw games, close losses of African players' teams increase peaceful protests in their original countries while not changing the likelihood of riots or armed conflicts. The effect is particularly large for non-ethnic protests targeted at a central government. Close losses also temporarily decrease people's trust in their country's leader. By contrast, close victories do not have equivalent or compensating effects on protests or public opinion. These results suggest asymmetric misattribution: people in Africa unreasonably blame domestic politicians for bad luck in European football games, prompting protests; but they do not credit politicians with football victories.  © 2022 The Author(s).

Rafadom,A genetic programming-based low-level instructions robot for realtimebattle,"RealTimeBattle is an environment in which robots controlled by programs fight each other. Programs control the simulated robots using low-level messages (e.g., turn radar, accelerate). Unlike other tools like Robocode, each of these robots can be developed using different programming languages. Our purpose is to generate, without human programming or other intervention, a robot that is highly competitive in RealTimeBattle. To that end, we implemented an Evolutionary Computation technique: Genetic Programming. The robot controllers created in the course of the experiments exhibit several different and effective combat strategies such as avoidance, sniping, encircling and shooting. To further improve their performance, we propose a function-set that includes short-term memory mechanisms, which allowed us to evolve a robot that is superior to all of the rivals used for its training. The robot was also tested in a bout with the winner of the previous “RealTimeBattle Championship,” which it won. Finally, our robot was tested in a multi-robot battle arena, with five simultaneous opponents, and obtained the best results among the contenders. © 2020 by the authors.

Rafadom,Performance and Return to Sport After Femoroacetabular Impingement Surgery in National Football League Players,"The purpose of this study was to determine the (l ) return-to-sport rate for National Football League (NILL players following femoroacetabular impingement surgery, (2) postoperative career length and games per season, (3) pre- and postoperative performance and (4) postoperative performance compared with control players matched by position, age, years of experience, and performance. National Football League athletes who underwent hip arthroscopy for femoroacetabular impingement and matched controls were identified. A Bonferroni correction was used to control for multiple comparisons, with statistical significance set at P <=.007. Fifty-five players (63 surgeries) were analyzed (mean age, 27.5+3.4 years; mean years in NFL at time of surgery, 4.7 +/- 2.9). Forty-seven (53 surgeries, 84.1%) NFL players returned to sport at a mean of 6.7 +/- 3.8 months following surgery. There was nu difference (P>.007) in the mean carom length of players in the control group (3.7 +/- 2.2 years) vs play- ers who underwent hip arthroscopy (3.5 +/- 2.1 years). There was no difference (P>.007) in mean games played per season of players in the control group (12.5 +/- 3.1) vs those who underwent hip arthroscopy (12.1 +/- 4.0). Quarterbacks had significantly better postoperative performance scores when compared with post-index matched controls (P=.007). The return-to-sport rate is high for NFL athletes after hip arthroscopy for femoroacetabular impingement.

,Betting on a buzz: Mispricing and inefficiency in online sportsbooks,"Bookmakers sell claims to bettors that depend on the outcomes of professional sports events. Like other financial assets, the wisdom of crowds could help sellers to price these claims more efficiently. We use the Wikipedia profile page views of professional tennis players involved in over 10,000 singles matches to construct a buzz factor. This measures the difference between players in their pre-match page views relative to the usual number of views they received over the previous year. The buzz factor significantly predicts mispricing by bookmakers. Using this fact to forecast match outcomes, we demonstrate that a strategy of betting on players who received more pre-match buzz than their opponents can generate substantial profits. These results imply that sportsbooks could price outcomes more efficiently by listening to the buzz. © 2022 The Author(s)",10.1016/j.ijforecast.2022.07.011,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85136297085&doi=10.1016%2fj.ijforecast.2022.07.011&partnerID=40&md5=12e8257ab473b52462eb4348bab905a3,SCOPUS,Si,Hace un estudio de como los corredores de apuestas pueden cometer errores en las cuotas debido a factores de popularidad,"Brier Score, Accuracy",Linear Regression - OLS (Ordinary Least Squares),Tenis,WTA,femenino,No,"normalización de datos, análisis de tendencias en volumen de búsqueda",10522 partidos,"Visualizaciones de páginas de Wikipedia antes de los partidos, ranking WTA, diferencia de ranking entre jugadoras, cuotas de apuestas de casas de apuestas en línea (Bet365 y otras), odds implícitas en el mercado",público,https://github.com/philiprami/betting_on_a_buzz y https://www.tennis-data.co.uk/,Evaluar si el “buzz” mediático (medido por visitas a perfiles de Wikipedia) predice errores sistemáticos en las cuotas de apuestas,Victoria o Derrota,las casas de apuestas subestiman sistemáticamente a las jugadoras con un mayor aumento en visitas a Wikipedia antes del partido,https://github.com/philiprami/betting_on_a_buzz y https://www.tennis-data.co.uk/,"2015/16, 2019/20","Philip Ramirez, J.

,A framework of interpretable match results prediction in football with FIFA ratings and team formation,"While forecasting football match results has long been a popular topic, a practical model for football participants, such as coaches and players, has not been considered in great detail. In this study, we propose a generalized and interpretable machine learning model framework that only requires coaches' decisions and player quality features for forecasting. By further allowing the model to embed historical match statistics, features that consist of significant information, during the training process the model was practical and achieved both high performance and interpretability. Using five years of data (over 1,700 matches) from the English Premier League, our results show that our model was able to achieve high performance with an F1-score of 0.47, compared to the baseline betting odds prediction, which had an F1-score of 0.39. Moreover, our framework allows football teams to adapt for tactical decision-making, strength and weakness identification, formation and player selection, and transfer target validation. The framework in this study would have proven the feasibility of building a practical match result forecast framework and may serve to inspire future studies. © 2023 Yeung et al.",10.1371/journal.pone.0284318,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85152604679&doi=10.1371%2fjournal.pone.0284318&partnerID=40&md5=2d120c8fd1349202f86a51ec7e3b903c,SCOPUS,Si,Modelo de aprendizaje automático para predecir resultados de partidos teniendo en cuenta las decisiones de los entrenadores y la condición de los jugadores,"F1 Score, Accuracy",Logistic Regression,Fútbol,premiere league,masculino,No,"Reducción de dimensiones en características de jugadores, agrupación de ratings de FIFA en categorías clave, eliminación de datos redundantes, predicción de estadísticas no raras antes del modelo final",1700 partidos,"Formaciones de equipo, estadísticas de partidos (disparos, cruces, tiros a puerta), atributos de jugadores basados en ratings de FIFA, odds de apuestas",público,https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hugomathien/soccer,Desarrollar un modelo interpretable para predecir resultados de partidos de fútbol basándose en características de jugadores y decisiones tácticas de entrenadores,Victoria o Derrota,El modelo XGBoost con características interpretables alcanzó un F1-score de 0.47,European Soccer Database en Kaggle,"2011/12, 2015/16","Calvin C.

Rafadom,Winning With Chaos in Association Football: Spatiotemporal Event Distribution Randomness Metric for Team Performance Evaluation,"Association football (commonly known as football or soccer) in the modern era places a greater emphasis on collaborating and working together as a team instead of relying solely on individual skills to strategize winning performances. The low-scoring and unpredictable nature of association football makes evaluating team performances challenging. Space creation and space utilization have been discussed in the football world lately. Existing literature evaluates this with on and off-ball runs by players for deceiving defenders to create open spaces. However, the contribution of these team ball movements’ enhanced randomness or chaotic nature to winning performances has yet to be explored. This work proposes a novel entropy-based time-series performance evaluation metric, EDRan, for quantifying this enhanced random nature by analyzing the spatial distribution of game events at regular intervals. Additionally, an unexplored cumulative ball possession matrix is used to quantify randomness. The correlation between the match winner and spatial event distribution randomness at regular intervals was analyzed. The significance of the proposed metric was demonstrated using a generalized linear model (GLM), which achieved an average accuracy of 80% for match-winning performance classification. The GLM p-values and coefficients revealed statistically significant relationships between the extracted temporal features and match-winning performances. Findings further revealed dispersed, highly random event distribution by winning teams during the early phases of the game, implying attacking behavior, followed by a compact, cautious playing style toward the end, suggesting that the game’s first-half performances are more pivotal. Despite the unpredictability of actual scores in association football, the proposed approach effectively captured the differences in performances between stronger and weaker teams with temporal relationships, highlighting its significance as a time-series metric for performance evaluation.",10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3413648,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10555217,IEEE,No,No es util ya que hace un analisis predictivo con el partido ya empezado cuando nosotros queremos realizar la prediccion de la cuota inicial,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,Prediction of FIFA World Cup Match Outcomes Based on Random Forests,"The prediction of ball game outcomes has emerged as a significant area in sports event forecasting, driven by the growing betting markets for football and basketball. Traditional methods, including human prediction analysis and statistical approaches, face limitations due to the complexity and numerous variables inherent in these games. The advent of machine learning has opened new avenues for enhancing prediction accuracy and efficiency in this field. The main work of this paper is based on FIFA rankings and international football match data from 1872 to 2018. It uses feature engineering techniques to process the data and applies the Random Forest algorithm to build a prediction model. The model shows high prediction accuracy through hyperparameter optimization using grid search techniques. Additionally, by simulating the FIFA World Cup match process and visualizing the knockout stage, the model's effectiveness in predicting actual match outcomes is validated. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",10.1145/3696500.3696512,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85212704866&doi=10.1145%2f3696500.3696512&partnerID=40&md5=cffa26c7dbed1f7b80fb125e6072e183,SCOPUS,Si,Usa random forests para predecir partidos usando datos históricos y rankings de FIFA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Spillover Effects in Contests with Heterogeneous Players - Evidence from European Football,"This paper analyzes spillover effects from previous matches against the future champion of a league. Using data from 78,264 European football games, the empirical results from a matching method show that favourites in the current match gain significantly fewer points after a match against the future league champion. By contrast, underdogs benefit from such a match, as they gain significantly more points. By considering shadow effects in the analysis, these results suggest that favourites put more effort into the match against the future champion and lower their effort level in the next match, which explains the negative spillover effects. As there are no significant shadow effects for underdogs, the positive spillover effects might be caused by positive ‘learning-by-doing’ effects. A subsequent logit regression using betting odds as control variables confirms the existence of the observed spillover effects. © 2020 The Author(s).

,Are Betting Markets Inefficient? Evidence From Simulations and Real Data,"Previous literature leaves the impression that betting market inefficiencies are widespread. However, most studies rely upon limited data and ignore biases’ persistence. Our simulation-based analyses show (1) the impact of low sample sizes on the chance to detect markets that only appear to be efficient and (2) the frequency of observing inefficient periods within fully efficient markets. Afterwards, we (3) empirically analyze real-world football betting markets for 14 consecutive seasons. While inefficiencies occur in singular seasons, they are not persistent or systematic across leagues. Moreover, our simulation-based analyses suggest that statistically significant effects in single seasons are likely to be observed even under full market efficiency. © The Author(s) 2023.",10.1177/15270025231204997,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85175374428&doi=10.1177%2f15270025231204997&partnerID=40&md5=856750326b3c2a81729f5b426045286e,SCOPUS,Si,Analiza la eficiencia de las cuotas a lo largo de varias temporadas,"Brier Score, ROI",Montecarlo simulation,Fútbol,"liga española, premiere league, Euroleague",masculino,No,"Ajuste de probabilidades implícitas en cuotas de apuestas, simulaciones para detectar sesgos en los datos, eliminación de valores atípicos",25564 partidos,"Probabilidades implícitas en cuotas de apuestas, resultados de partidos, efecto localía, asistencia a los estadios, margen de las casas de apuestas",público,http://www.football-data.co.uk/,Evaluar la eficiencia de los mercados de apuestas en fútbol y analizar si los sesgos encontrados en estudios previos son persistentes o resultado del azar,Score,"Se encontró que, si bien hay temporadas con sesgos de apuestas (como el favorite-longshot bias y el home bias), estos no son sistemáticos ni persistentes a lo largo del tiempo",http://www.football-data.co.uk/,"2005/06, 2018/19","David Winkelmann, Marius Ötting, Christian Deutscher, Tomasz Makarewicz",,"Aunque se analiza un período amplio, el estudio solo considera las cinco grandes ligas europeas, lo que podría limitar la aplicabilidad de los resultados a otros mercados"
Rafadom,"Water Polo Shooting Performance: Differences between World Championship Winning, Drawing and Losing Teams","Shooting performance of globally ranked winning, drawing and losing water polo teams was compared, and technical and tactical success indicators were identified. In total, 886 shots from a world championship final round were videotaped and teams were clustered for a performance evaluation (considering differences between game outcomes). Shooting speeds were assessed by a radar, with higher values observed at further distances from the goal than in the central area close to the goal (p ≤ 0.00, ES: 2.54). Shots tended to be more frequent from the central corridor, with ≤50% and >75% relative shot efficacy attained from field areas 3 and 6; winning teams obtained better results. Furthermore, winners had greater success than losers when shooting from field area 2 (p ≤ 0.04, ES: 1.13) and towards the goal zone 2 (p < 0.03, ES: 1.10). They also attained better efficacy regarding shots towards goal zone 1, had better efficacy on the part of centre-forwards (p ≤ 0.05, ES: 0.85-1.27), and were more effective regarding shots without a frontal defensive block. In addition, contingency analysis highlighted shots performed from field area 6, without a defensive block, toward the bottom left goal corner, and through man-up play as success indicators (all for p ≤ 0.005). We concluded that world-level winning teams homogeneously distributed their shot opportunities at the second offensive line with balanced efficacy, creating variability and uncertainty in their opponents' defensive action. Elite level players must be capable of interpreting game situations with intelligence and proper decision making.

,Forecasting football matches by predicting match statistics,"This paper considers the use of observed and predicted match statistics as inputs to forecasts for the outcomes of football matches. It is shown that, were it possible to know the match statistics in advance, highly informative forecasts of the match outcome could be made. Whilst, in practice, match statistics are clearly never available prior to the match, this leads to a simple philosophy. If match statistics can be predicted pre-match, and if those predictions are accurate enough, it follows that informative match forecasts can be made. Two approaches to the prediction of match statistics are demonstrated: Generalised Attacking Performance (GAP) ratings and a set of ratings based on the Bivariate Poisson model which are named Bivariate Attacking (BA) ratings. It is shown that both approaches provide a suitable methodology for predicting match statistics in advance and that they are informative enough to provide information beyond that reflected in the odds. A long term and robust gambling profit is demonstrated when the forecasts are combined with two betting strategies.",10.3233/JSA-200462,http://dx.doi.org/10.3233/JSA-200462,WOS,Si,"Es literalmente nuestro trabajo, prediccion de resultados para calculos de cuotas",rank probability score,Normal Mean Regression,Fútbol,"liga española, premiere league, Euroleague",masculino,No,"Eliminación de valores atípicos, normalización de datos, conversión de probabilidades implícitas de cuotas de apuestas",162435 partidos,"Número de disparos a puerta, disparos fuera, córners, goles, cuotas de apuestas, probabilidades implícitas en las cuotas, estadísticas ofensivas y defensivas de los equipos",público,http://www.football-data.co.uk/,Predecir el resultado de los partidos de fútbol mediante la predicción de estadísticas del partido antes del inicio,Victoria o Derrota,"Se encontró que predecir estadísticas de partido (disparos, córners) antes del partido mejora la precisión de los modelos de predicción de resultados",http://www.football-data.co.uk/,"2000/01, 2018/19",Edward Wheatcroft,,El estudio solo considera ligas europeas y no incorpora datos en vivo que podrían mejorar la precisión de los modelos
Rafadom,Concurrent validity of barbell force measured from video-based barbell kinematics during the snatch in male elite weightlifters,"This study examined the concurrent validity of an inverse dynamic (force computed from barbell acceleration [reference method]) and a work-energy (force computed from work at the barbell [alternative method]) approach to measure the mean vertical barbell force during the snatch using kinematic data from video analysis. For this purpose, the acceleration phase of the snatch was analyzed in thirty male medal winners of the 2018 weightlifting World Championships (age: 25.2±3.1 years; body mass: 88.9±28.6 kg). Vertical barbell kinematics were measured using a custom-made 2D real-time video analysis software. Agreement between the two computational approaches was assessed using Bland-Altman analysis, Deming regression, and Pearson product-moment correlation. Further, principal component analysis in conjunction with multiple linear regression was used to assess whether individual differences related to the two approaches are due to the waveforms of the acceleration time-series data. Results indicated no mean difference (p > 0.05; d = -0.04) and an extremely large correlation (r = 0.99) between the two approaches. Despite the high agreement, the total error of individual differences was 8.2% (163.0 N). The individual differences can be explained by a multiple linear regression model (R2 adj = 0.86) on principal component scores from the principal component analysis of vertical barbell acceleration time-series waveforms. Findings from this study indicate that the individual errors of force measures can be associated with the inverse dynamic approach. This approach uses vertical barbell acceleration data from video analysis that is prone to error. Therefore, it is recommended to use the work-energy approach to compute mean vertical barbell force as this approach did not rely on vertical barbell acceleration. © 2021 Sandau et al.

Rafadom,Predicting the outcome of the Ryder cup,"The Ryder Cup is played for between the golfers of Europe and the USA and consists of 8 foursomes, 8 fourballs and 12 singles matches played over 3 days. Each match is worth one point; hence, to win, a team must gain at least 14½ points. In live coverage of the event, considerable attention is paid to the predicted outcome but typically this is assessed by the crude method of assuming that any match a team is currently leading is worth one point and any match currently level is worth ½ point. No distinction is made between a match where a team is one up after one hole and one where it is eight up with nine to play. A Markovian model provides a more well-informed prediction of the outcome, in terms of the expected number of points to be won by each team given the current score in each match. This takes account of estimates of the probabilities of holes being won or halved in the different formats of fourballs, foursomes and singles, based on historical data from the Ryder Cup and other major professional golf tournaments. As well as an expected final score, the model also provides a probability distribution of the event outcome and could be used to estimate the implicit odds of any outcome for ‘in-play’ betting.",10.1093/imaman/dps008,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8146412,IEEE,No,Uso de cadenas de markov para prediccion de resultados pero a tiempo real,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The survey included a screening tool for gambling, as well as measures for depression and sport anxiety. The overall rate of players identified as at-risk gamblers was 16.1%. Linear regression analyses revealed that depression and sport anxiety significantly predicted gambling behaviors, and explained 2% and 6% of variance, respectively. The age of the players and the age at which they specialize did not moderate these relationships.

,In-game soccer outcome prediction with offline reinforcement learning,"Predicting outcomes in soccer is crucial for various stakeholders, including teams, leagues, bettors, the betting industry, media, and fans. With advancements in computer vision, player tracking data has become abundant, leading to the development of sophisticated soccer analytics models. However, existing models often rely solely on spatiotemporal features derived from player tracking data, which may not fully capture the complexities of in-game dynamics. In this paper, we present an end-to-end system that leverages raw event and tracking data to predict both offensive and defensive actions, along with the optimal decision for each game scenario, based solely on historical game data. Our model incorporates the effectiveness of these actions to accurately predict win probabilities at every minute of the game. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving an accuracy of 87% in predicting offensive and defensive actions. Furthermore, our in-game outcome prediction model exhibits an error rate of 0.1, outperforming counterpart models and bookmakers’ odds. © The Author(s) 2024.",10.1007/s10994-024-06611-1,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85203161277&doi=10.1007%2fs10994-024-06611-1&partnerID=40&md5=375ae8aacfe721afdfec3bdcb16beaa2,SCOPUS,Si,Predicción de resultados de futbol teniendo en cuenta datos de eventos y tracking de jugadores,Accuracy,Logistic Regression,Fútbol,Liga Belga,masculino,No,"Fusión de datos de tracking y eventos, normalización de posiciones de jugadores y balón, cálculo de métricas de efectividad de equipos, eliminación de valores atípicos",430 partidos,"oordenadas (x, y) de jugadores y balón, tipo de acción (pase, tiro, intercepción, despeje), métricas de posesión, probabilidad de gol esperada (xG), goles marcados, tarjetas amarillas y rojas, tiempo restante del partido",privado,-------------,"Predecir la probabilidad de victoria en tiempo real durante un partido de fútbol, basándose en decisiones óptimas inferidas mediante aprendizaje por refuerzo",Victoria o Derrota,"El modelo basado en TGN y CQL logró una precisión del 87% en la predicción de acciones ofensivas y defensivas, y una tasa de error de solo 0.1 en la predicción de resultados en tiempo real",-------------,"2020/21, 2021/22","Pegah Rahimian, Balazs Mark Mihalyi, Laszlo Toka",,"El dataset se basa exclusivamente en la Belgian Pro League, lo que podría limitar la generalización a otras ligas con diferentes estilos de juego"
Rafadom,Granzyme B in circulating CD8+ T cells as a biomarker of immunotherapy effectiveness and disability in neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders,"Background and objective: Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD) are chronical inflammatory demyelinating diseases of the central nervous system (CNS) and the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Several recent studies have demonstrated that T cells play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of NMOSD.In this study, we investigated CD8+ T cell phenotypes and levels of the cytotoxic protein granzyme B (GzmB), as well as their potential clinical application in NMOSD. Methods: In this study, 90 peripheral blood samples were collected from 59 NMOSD patients with seropositive anti-aquaporin-4 (AQP4) antibodies and 31 sex- and age-matched healthy donors (HDs). Flow cytometry was used to detect circulating levels of GzmB and CD8+ T cell subpopulations, including naïve (TN, CCD7+CD45RA+), central memory (TCM, CCD7+CD45RA-), effector memory (TEM, CCD7-CD45RA-), terminal differentiation effector memory cells (TEMRA, CCD7-CD45RA+) in both groups. The associations between GzmB levels in CD8+T cells and clinical characteristics of NMOSD were evaluated. Results: NMOSD patients exhibited significantly decreased proportions of CD8+TN cells and increased proportions of highly differentiated CD8+T cells (TEMRA) compared with HDs. In addition, levels of GzmB in CD8+ T cells were markedly higher in NMOSD patients than in HDs. Moreover, we observed that high proportions of GzmB-expressing CD8+ T cells were more common in patients with a poor response to immunotherapies, and showed a good potential to distinguish poor responders from responders (ACU=0.89). Clinical correlation analysis indicated that high levels of GzmB in CD8+ T cells were not only related to severe disability but also significantly associated with increased serum levels of neurofilament light (NFL) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Multivariate linear regression analyses further suggested that GzmB expression in CD8+ T cells was predominantly associated with disability and immunotherapy effectiveness in NMOSD, independent of the sex, age, and disease phase. Transcription factor T-bet in CD8+ T cells were also significantly elevated in NMOSD and were associated with increasing number of circulating CD8+TEMRA cells and GzmB-expressing CD8+T cells. Conclusions: Our study support the involvement of GzmB-expressing CD8+ T cells in the inflammatory response in patients with NMOSD and provide a potential biomarker for disease immunotherapy effectiveness and disability progression.

Rafadom,Paying while playing: examining the influence of interaction with gamified elements in fantasy sports on in-app spending,"Research question: Prompting consumers to spend more in fantasy sport applications is necessary to provide supplementary sources of revenue for sport organizations. The current research draws on gamification literature to examine consumers’ engagement with three prominent fantasy sports motivational affordances of points, badges, and leaderboards and its relationship with in-app spending. Research methods: Multiple linear regression was used to analyze the behavioral data of 914 paying consumers in a fantasy sports application that had challenges available for top European football leagues. Results and Findings: Consumers who were unable to gain points, acquire badges frequently, or progress in leaderboards interacted more often with the fantasy sports application. Consumers spent more in the fantasy sports application if their rate of gaining points was low and their rate of interactivity with the platform was high. Rate of acquiring badges and leaderboard progress had no significant relationship with in-app spending. However, consumers’ rate of interactivity with the platform influenced the relationship between leaderboard progress, and in-app spending. Implications: Findings contribute to the sport consumer behavior literature, specifically in the fantasy sports context, through gamified touchpoints. This research offers valuable insights for entities affiliated with fantasy sports, such as gambling businesses, sports network channels, sport leagues and teams, and fantasy sport companies, on strategies to sustain their platforms through enhanced revenue generation. © 2024 The Author(s).

Rafadom,Stadium visitors' smartphone usage and digital resource integration,"Purpose: Smartphones have become ubiquitous devices that enable individuals to integrate digital resources in virtually all value co-creation processes, including visiting sport events. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to understand smartphone-enabled digital resource integration in the context of sport events from an individual intra-perspective. It thereby connects the perspectives of Service Dominant Logic and Experiential Computing. Design/methodology/approach: A conceptual model was developed and empirically tested utilizing a survey of 707 visitors of eight first and second league soccer, handball and basketball matches in Germany. Partial least squares structural equation modeling was applied to test the proposed hypotheses. Findings: The results reveal that stadium visitors integrate sport event-related and unrelated digital resources to co-create value at sport events. While event-unrelated digital resources generally have more influence on visitors' perceived value, their importance is decreasing with higher team identification. Digital resources in the form of sports betting opportunities are only relevant in some specific contexts. Hence, both individual and contextual characteristics determine digital resource integration. Originality/value: This study integrates the perspectives of value co-creation at sport events and experiential computing and proposes a conceptual model exploring how sport event visitors enrich their experience through the integration of sport event-related and unrelated smartphone-enabled digital resources. By illuminating the intra-level perspective of sport event visitors' resource integration, it provides the basis for future studies on digital resource integration on higher levels of aggregation including engagement platforms and entire sport event ecosystems. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",10.1108/SBM-10-2019-0099,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089553880&doi=10.1108%2fSBM-10-2019-0099&partnerID=40&md5=1dddcaeafd334f00fcf3e3271546918f,SCOPUS,No,Uso de tecnologia en asistentes a eventos deportivos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Rafadom,How to play fantasy sports strategically (and win),"Daily fantasy sports (DFS) is a multibillion-dollar industry with millions of annual users and widespread appeal among sports fans across a broad range of popular sports. Building on recent work, we provide a coherent framework for constructing DFS portfolios where we explicitly model the behavior of other DFS players. We formulate an optimization problem that accurately describes the DFS problem for a risk-neutral decision maker in both double-up and top-heavy payoff settings. Our formulation maximizes the expected reward subject to feasibility constraints, and we relate this formulation to mean-variance optimization and the outperformance of stochastic benchmarks. Using this connection, we show how the problem can be reduced to the problem of solving a series of binary quadratic programs. We also propose an algorithm for solving the problem where the decision maker can submit multiple entries to the DFS contest. This algorithm is motivated by submodularity properties of the objective function and by some new results on parimutuel betting. One of the contributions of our work is the introduction of a Dirichlet-multinomial data-generating process for modeling opponents’ team selections, and we estimate the parameters of this model via Dirichlet regressions. A further benefit to modeling opponents’ team selections is that it enables us to estimate the value, in a DFS setting, of both insider trading and collusion. We demonstrate the value of our framework by applying it to DFS contests during the 2017 National Football League season.

Rafadom,Toward learning dynamic origin-destination matrices from crowd density heatmaps,"Knowing the origins and destinations of pedestrians' paths is key to the initialization of crowd simulations. Unfortunately, they are difficult to measure in the real world. This is one major challenge for live predictions during events such as festivals, soccer games, protest marches, and many others. Sensor data can be used to feed real-world observations into simulations in real-time. As input data for this study, we use density heatmaps generated from real-world trajectory data obtained from stereo sensors. Density information is compact, of constant size, and in general easier to obtain than e.g., individual trajectories. Therefore, the information limitation improves the applicability to other scenarios. We include the absolute pedestrian trip counts from origins to destinations during a brief time interval in an OD matrix, including unknown destinations due to sensor errors. Our goal is to estimate these OD matrices from a series of density heatmaps for the same interval. For this, we compute the ground truth OD matrices and density heatmaps using real-world trajectory data from a train station. We employ linear regression as a statistical learning method for estimation. We observe that the linear share of the relationship between density and OD matrix is estimated successfully. Nevertheless, a portion of the data remains that cannot be explained. We attempt to overcome this difficulty with random forest as a nonlinear model. The results indicate that both a linear and a nonlinear model can estimate some features of the OD matrices. However, there is no clear winner in terms of the chosen metric, the R 2 score. Overall, our findings are a strong indicator that OD matrices can indeed be estimated from density heatmaps extracted automatically from sensors.  © 2022 IOP Publishing Ltd and SISSA Medialab srl.",10.1088/1742-5468/ac6255,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85130468861&doi=10.1088%2f1742-5468%2fac6255&partnerID=40&md5=ed4131a9c3e00488987fd754023aa8a1,SCOPUS,No,Estimacion de origen-destino de peatones con sensores,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Rafadom,Random Forest-Based Fantasy Football Team Selection,"Fantasy football is a popular pastime that involves selecting a team of players and competing against others based on the real-life performance of those players. The success of a fantasy team is largely determined by the ability to accurately predict player performance and select a strong lineup. A team's selection can be influenced by several factors, including the players' current form, injuries, tactical considerations, and opposition analysis. The concept of ""form"" in soccer refers to a player or team's current level of performance. A player or team can be described as ""in form"" if they are currently performing well and consistently winning matches, while they can be described as ""out of form"" if their performance is poor and they are losing matches. We have developed a machine-learning model using a random forest algorithm to assist in this process. The model is capable of predicting the performance of individual players and generating a predicted optimal team lineup. By training multiple decision trees on different subsets of the data and averaging their predictions, the model is able to reduce overfitting and improve the generalization performance. The model also could analyze the key attributes that are needed for a particular position, opposition analysis, and tactical considerations. The model was back tested on historical data to generate predicted lineups for each match of the past three seasons. These predicted lineups were then used to simulate fantasy football leagues, with the model's team competing against other teams selected by human managers. We compared the model's predicted outcomes to the actual outcomes of the matches. The model had a Mean Square Error (MSE) of 4.921 and a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 2.2275. This means that almost 70% of the time the team created by the model could help win the match for the person betting on fantasy football. This means that over the long run, the model could generate 20% of profitability on average.",10.1109/ICACCS57279.2023.10113019,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10113019,IEEE,No,Generación de alineaciones optimas,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Profiting from overreaction in soccer betting odds,"Betting odds are generally considered to represent accurate reflections of the underlying probabilities for the outcomes of sporting events. There are, however, known to be a number of inherent biases such as the favorite-longshot bias in which outsiders are generally priced with poorer value odds than favorites. Using data from European soccer matches, this paper demonstrates the existence of another bias in which the match odds overreact to favorable and unfavorable runs of results. A statistic is defined, called the Combined Odds Distribution (COD) statistic, which measures the performance of a team relative to expectations given their odds over previous matches. Teams that overperform expectations tend to have a high COD statistic and those that underperform tend to have a low COD statistic. Using data from twenty different leagues over twelve seasons, it is shown that teams with a low COD statistic tend to be assigned more generous odds by bookmakers. This can be exploited and a sustained and robust profit can be made. It is suggested that the bias in the odds can be explained in the context of the “hot hand fallacy”, in which gamblers overestimate variation in the ability of each team over time. © 2020 De Gruyter.

Rafadom,Does Foreign Investment Affect Sporting and Managerial Efficiency? The Case of English Football Clubs,"The number of foreign owners in football clubs has recently increased in Europe and especially in England. This study aims to analyze whether clubs owned by foreign investors show different parameters of sporting and managerial efficiency. We use data on expected performance (from betting odds), wage costs, and the results of football clubs in the English Premier League (EPL) and English Football League Championship (EFL) over 13 seasons. We estimate different measures of efficiency using three alternative methods: expected vs. actual performance index, nonparametric conditional data envelopment analysis (DEA), and stochastic frontier, while considering foreign ownership as an exogenous factor. Our results suggest that there are not significant differences between domestic- and foreign-owned clubs. © 2023 Fitness Information Technology.

,Dense Neural Network used to Amplify the Forecasting Accuracy of real-time Human Swarms,"Artificial Swarm Intelligence (ASI) is a hybrid AI technology that enables distributed human groups to think together in real-time systems modeled on natural swarms. Prior research has shown that by forming human swarms, networked groups can substantially amplify their combined intelligence and produce significantly more accurate forecasts than traditional methods. The present study explores whether the rich behavioral data collected during swarming can be used to further increase the accuracy of swarm-based forecasts. To do this, a dense neural network was used to process the data collected during a set of swarm-based forecasts and generate a Conviction Index (CI) for each forecast that estimates its expected accuracy. This method was then tested in an authentic forecasting task - wagering on sporting events against the Vegas odds. Specifically, groups of sports fans, working as real-time swarms, were tasked with predicting the outcome of 238 NBA games over 25 consecutive weeks. As a baseline, the swarms achieved an impressive 25% net return on investment (ROI) against the Vegas Odds. This was compared to an enhanced method that used Conviction Index to (a) estimate the strength of each forecast and then (b) wager only on forecasts of sufficient strength. The CI-selected wagers yielded a 57% net ROI against Vegas Odds. This is a significant gain, equivalent to more than doubling the ROI of the naive swarm betting strategy.",10.1109/CICN.2019.13,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/CICN.2019.13,WOS,Si,"Uso de ""enjambre artificial"" para mejorar las predicciones","Accuracy, ROI","Red Neuronal, Random Forest",Baloncesto,NBA,masculino,No,"Normalización de datos de comportamiento humano en predicciones, extracción de Conviction Index",238 partidos,"Comportamiento de predicción de humanos en tiempo real, probabilidad de acierto en apuestas, cuotas de casas de apuestas de Las Vegas, nivel de confianza en las decisiones de grupo, número de participantes, tiempo para llegar a una predicción",privado,------------,Mejorar la precisión de predicción de partidos de la NBA utilizando inteligencia de enjambre humano,Victoria o Derrota,"Se encontró que la estrategia basada en inteligencia de enjambre alcanzó un ROI del 25% contra las Vegas Odds, y que el uso del Conviction Index (CI) para filtrar apuestas aumentó el ROI hasta un 57%",-------------,2017/18,"Gregg Willcox, Louis Rosenberg, Rory Donovan, Hans Schumann",,"Se basa en una muestra relativamente pequeña de juegos y en una estrategia de apuestas teórica, lo que podría no replicarse en entornos reales"
Rafadom,AN EFFECTIVE DISTRACTION? FANTASY FOOTBALL DURING THE TIMES OF COVID-19,"The popularity of fantasy sports has increased exponentially over the last few decades. The existing literature has predominantly focused on the negative effects of fantasy football (or, fantasy sports in general) on mental health because of its association with gambling and internet addictions. Using primary data collected through online surveys, this study attempts to examine the role of fantasy football within a completely new context by asking whether it acted as an effective distraction for the fantasy football managers during the COVID-19 pandemic. About 70% of the participants consider fantasy football to be an effective escape from day-to-day activities. Approximately two-thirds of the managers in our sample report that they were negatively affected by the suspension of fantasy football at the advent of COVID-19. Once resumed, fantasy football helped mitigate some of the negative emotions caused by COVID-19 and it worked as a distraction for 78.5% of the managers during the pandemic. The statistical analysis indicates that though the role of fantasy football as a distraction was evident across all age groups the effect was more acute in case of the highly involved managers (defined by, level of competitiveness and time invested in the game during weekends). © 2023, Centre of Sociological Research.

,Survival modeling of goal arrival times in English premier league,"Prediction and modeling of association football (soccer) outcomes has gained increasing interest in the scientific community in recent years, both due to betting concerns and the need for a deeper understanding of the factors influencing soccer events. We introduce and examine the validity of a Bayesian model, which belongs to the class of accelerated failure time (survival) models and is characterized by its straightforward structure. We implement MCMC methodology to estimate the posterior summaries of the model parameters and suggest a novel algorithm that can be used to transform simulated goal arrival times into predicted goals. The proposed model achieves exceptional in-sample and out-of-sample performance by replicating the entire league in a remarkably precise manner and by making accurate predictions on the second half of the league using the first half as a training dataset. The structure of the proposed model is extendable, allowing for the inclusion of in-play covariates that can be used to further map the complex dynamics of soccer matches. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.",10.1007/s00180-024-01589-9,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85213733100&doi=10.1007%2fs00180-024-01589-9&partnerID=40&md5=4162489120b0fead455a29a31d3b1097,SCOPUS,Si,Uso de modelos bayesianos para la prediccion de resultados de futbol,Brier Score,"Bayes, Distribucion Poisson",Fútbol,premiere league,masculino,No,"Transformación de tiempos de llegada de goles en datos censurados, normalización de variables, modelado de inter-arrival times con métodos bayesianos, exclusión de partidos sin goles",380 partidos,"Tiempos de llegada de goles (en minutos), marcador del partido, efecto de jugar en casa, características ofensivas y defensivas de los equipos, información sobre tarjetas rojas",mix,https://understat.com/league/EPL,"Modelar la llegada de goles en partidos de fútbol mediante modelos de supervivencia, en lugar de enfocarse solo en el resultado final del partido",Tiempo primer gol,"Se encontró que el modelo Weibull supera a modelos tradicionales como el doble Poisson, logrando una mejor capacidad predictiva para el tiempo de llegada de los goles","Understat, Football Data UK",2018/19,"Ilias Leriou, Ioannis Ntzoufras",,"El modelo depende de datos de tiempos de llegada de goles que no son fácilmente accesibles en bases de datos públicas, lo que limita su reproducibilidad"
Rafadom,Game location effect in game-related statistics and pre-shot combination differences between winners and losers during the basketball ACB COVID-19 season,"The aim of this study was to assess pre-shot combinations and game-location influence, together with the traditional game-related statistics to evaluate their impact in the performance of the teams in the Asociación de Clubs de Baloncesto (ACB) Spanish basketball league. The COVID-19 season was a great opportunity to better analyse the effect of game-location among ACB-teams to evaluate the differences between winners and losers. A retrospective cross-sectional study of the 2019–2020 ACB season (137 games of the regular season and 33 games of the final stage) was carried out. Game-related statistics were gathered from InStat (https://basketball.instatscout.com/). To evaluate the key performance indicators in this context, a discriminant analysis together with a binary logistic regression were run. The main results revealed that specific variables (normalized per minute played), such as points, field-goal percentage, field goals made, defensive rebounds, assists, and contested field goals made, played a crucial role in classifying winners and losers (p<0.05). Defensive rebounds (0.29±0.05 vs 0.24±0.04, p < 0.001), and assists (0.23±0.05 vs 0.19 ±0.04, p = 0.042), were key performance indicators for home-court winners. Defensive rebounds (0.29±0.05 vs 0.25±0.04, p < 0.001), and field-goal percentage (48.2±5.31 vs 42.7±5.95, p = 0.009) were key performance variables for away-court winners. Neutral-court winners had better isolation efficiency (49.5±31.6 vs 33.3±31.4, p < 0.05) and contested shot percentage (48.2±6.02 vs 44.8±5.34, p < 0.05) in the context of neutral-court tournaments. Uncontested shots and pick-and-roll efficiency seem not to be so important in the ACB when compared to the (National Basketball Association) NBA. Teams should look for players who assist to good shooters, as well as the presence of specialized players proficient in defensive rebounding. In the context of neutral-court tournaments, the importance of isolations and contested-shot performance is critical.

,Low competitive status elicits aggression in healthy young men: Behavioural and neural evidence,"Winners are commonly assumed to compete more aggressively than losers. Here, we find overwhelming evidence for the opposite. We first demonstrate that low-ranking teams commit more fouls than they receive in top-tier soccer, ice hockey and basketball men's leagues. We replicate this effect in the laboratory, showing that male participants deliver louder sound blasts to a rival when placed in a low-status position. Using neuroimaging, we characterize brain activity patterns that encode competitive status as well as those that facilitate status-dependent aggression in healthy young men. These analyses reveal three key findings. First, anterior hippocampus and striatum contain multivariate representations of competitive status. Second, interindividual differences in status-dependent aggression are linked with a sharper status differentiation in the striatum and with greater reactivity to status-enhancing victories in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex. Third, activity in ventromedial, ventrolateral and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is associated with trial-wise increases in status-dependent aggressive behaviour. Taken together, our results run counter to narratives glorifying aggression in competitive situations. Rather, we show that those in the lower ranks of skill-based hierarchies are more likely to behave aggressively and identify the potential neural basis of this phenomenon. © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

,The Ranking Prediction of NBA Playoffs Based on Improved PageRank Algorithm,"It is of great significance to predict the results accurately based on the statistics of sports competition for participants research, commercial cooperation, advertising, and gambling profit. Aiming at the phenomenon that the PageRank page sorting algorithm is prone to subject deviation, the category similarity between pages is introduced into the PageRank algorithm. In the PR value calculation formula of the PageRank algorithm, the factor W(u, v) between pages is added to replace the original Nu (the number of links to page u). In this way, the content category between pages is considered, and the shortcoming of theme deviation will be improved. The time feedback factor in the PageRank-time algorithm is used for reference, and the time feedback factor is added to the first improved PR value calculation formula. Based on statistics from 1230 games during the NBA 2018-2019 regular season, this paper ranks the team strength with improved PageRank algorithm and compares the results with the ranking of regular-season points and the result of playoffs. The results show that it is consistent with the regular-season points ranking in the eastern division by the use of improved PageRank algorithm, but there is a difference in the second ranking in the western division. In the prediction of top four in playoffs, it predicts three of the four teams.  © 2021 Fan Yang and Jun Zhang.",10.1155/2021/6641242,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85101943420&doi=10.1155%2f2021%2f6641242&partnerID=40&md5=ffbe9e31647b4abbdcfeccf0e29f93e8,SCOPUS,Si,Uso de un PageRank mejorado para prediccion de resultados en partidos de la NBA,"Accuracy, PageRank",Markov Chain,Baloncesto,NBA,masculino,No,"Eliminación de partidos con resultados aleatorios (prórrogas o victorias por diferencia mínima), normalización de puntuaciones, ajuste de pesos de los equipos basado en relaciones de victorias y derrotas",1230 partidos,"Resultados de partidos, puntuaciones de equipos, enfrentamientos entre equipos, estadísticas de victorias y derrotas, estructura de la conferencia",público,------------,Predecir los equipos mejor posicionados en los playoffs de la NBA utilizando un algoritmo mejorado de PageRank en base a los resultados de la temporada regular,Ranking,"El modelo predijo correctamente tres de los cuatro equipos en el top 4 de la NBA, con una precisión alta en la conferencia Este pero algunas desviaciones en la conferencia Oeste",Datos oficiales de la NBA,2018/19,"Fan Yang, Jun Zhang",,"No considera factores como lesiones, cambios en alineaciones o influencia de localía más allá de la estructura general del torneo"
Rafadom,"No crowd, no roar, no home advantage: evidence from ice hockey","Research questionThe COVID-19 pandemic entailed a period where no spectators were allowed to attend arena events. This provided a unique opportunity to study how the non-presence of supportive home crowds affects home advantage in sports. In this paper, we examine if there is such a home advantage for ice hockey.Research methodsUsing data from four consecutive seasons of Norwegian ice hockey, we apply team-fixed and referee-fixed effects regression analysis to identify how the non-presence of home crowds affects two aspects of home advantage in ice hockey: goal scoring and number of suspensions.ResultsWhen matches are played in front of no home crowd, away teams score more goals to reduce the initial goal scoring difference in favor of home teams. When playing in front of no home crowd, home teams also get more suspensions causing more power plays for away teams to reduce the initial difference in number of suspensions favoring home teams. Finally, more suspensions for home teams are positively correlated with goal scoring for away teams. This suggests that the absence of home crowds also influences goal scoring indirectly for away teams, i.e. through more suspensions for home teams.ImplicationsWhen two teams of equal performance-ability meet up, hockey team owners, coaches, people betting on hockey matches, and fans/spectators could all benefit from knowing that a roaring home crowd might be the critical issue that tips the scale in the home team's favor.",10.1080/16184742.2023.2221684,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/16184742.2023.2221684,WOS,No,Impacto del equipo en la ausencia del público,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Rafadom,Does the Dual Representation System of Player Agents in International Football Benefit Players? An Economic Analysis,"It is common in international football for the same agent to be paid both commission fees by the purchasing club for negotiating a player salary and a transfer fee. This dual representation creates a potential conflict of interest for the agent. The agent may not negotiate the highest salary for the player if a higher salary reduces the likelihood of a successful transfer by lowering the resources available for the transfer fee. We construct a gamble model of the transfer process and simulate the ex-ante agent commissions rates, expected player salary, transfer fee and club profit under the assumption of dual representation where the buying club pays all agent commissions. The assumption that the quality of the agent increases with the commission rate is essential to the model.

Rafadom,Traces of (dis)organised crime in sports gambling: a case study of the 2011 K-League match-fixing scandal,"Gambling-related match-fixing is a form of corruption that has become a global issue particularly since the start of the new millennium. Research on match-fixing has often emphasised the involvement of mafia-like criminal groups in match-fixing arrangements. By incorporating an activity-centred view of organised crime, this paper examines how, and to what extent, organised crime is involved in betting-related match-fixing with particular focus on the 2011 Korean football scandal. Analysing data from 11 in-depth interviews with government, football and gambling officials and two convicted footballers, this paper traces the relative contributions of external criminal influences and internal vulnerabilities of the football league towards the occurrence of the K-League’s match-fixing cases. The results suggest that illegal betting operators’ exploitation of match-fixing to hedge risks demonstrates the influence of external criminal groups. However, risks were also observed within the football sector (e.g., financial and performance imbalances in the league, normalised betting and inside-trading amongst footballers, close social links with organised mobs, etc.) revealing that, at that time, K-football was not only susceptible to external criminal influences but facilitated the opportunistic structure for match-fixing. Overall, this study highlights that match-fixing is not solely instigated by organised crime groups, but can also be incubated within a sport whose culture, management and ethics are not ready to co-exist with gambling. © 2023, The Author(s).",10.1007/s12117-023-09518-w,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85177078548&doi=10.1007%2fs12117-023-09518-w&partnerID=40&md5=060afa5225fa68fa1a2e8b6d9b209b12,SCOPUS,No,Influencia del crimen y la corrupción en el futbol coreano,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Machine-Learning-Based Statistical Arbitrage Football Betting,"Across countries and continents, football (soccer) has drawn increasingly more attention over the last decades and developed into a huge commercial complex. Consequently, the market of bookmakers providing the possibility to bet on the result of football matches grew rapidly, especially with the appearance of the internet. With a high number of games every week in multiple countries, football league matches hold enormous potential for generating profits over time with the use of advanced betting strategies. In this paper, we use machine learning for predicting the outcome of football league matches by exploiting data about match characteristics. Based on insights from the field of statistical arbitrage stock market trading, we show that one could generate meaningful profits over time by betting accordingly. A simulation study analyzing the matches of the five top European football leagues from season 2013/14 to 2017/18 presented economically and statistically significant returns achieved by exploiting large data sets with modern machine learning algorithms. In contrast to these modern algorithms, the break-even point could not be reached with an ordinary linear regression approach or simple betting strategies, e.g. always betting on the home team. © 2019, Gesellschaft für Informatik e.V. and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",10.1007/s13218-019-00610-4,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088026777&doi=10.1007%2fs13218-019-00610-4&partnerID=40&md5=a203a6a5ad1d07f5fe446580a88182d7,SCOPUS,Si,Uso de machine learning para 5 de las principales ligas europeas de futbol y analiza el enfoque a apuestas rentables,"Accuracy, RMSE, MAE, ROI","Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Support Vector Machine, Linear Regresion",Fútbol,"premiere league, liga española, Serie A, Ligue 1(francia), Bundesliga",masculino,No,"Eliminación de partidos con resultados no representativos (goleadas atípicas), normalización de características, cálculo de probabilidades implícitas en cuotas de apuestas, transformación de datos de rendimiento en tasas relativas",8082 partidos,"Posesión de balón, número de pases, duelos aéreos, tiros a puerta, faltas cometidas, tarjetas, número de córners, cuotas de apuestas de Bet365",público,https://www.football-data.co.uk/,Predecir los resultados de partidos de fútbol con modelos de aprendizaje automático y evaluar la viabilidad de estrategias de arbitraje estadístico en apuestas deportivas,Point Difference,"Se encontró que el Random Forest obtuvo la mayor precisión con un 75.62%, superando otros modelos.

,Do market participants misprice lottery-type assets? Evidence from the European soccer betting market,"This paper addresses findings from previous asset pricing research that reveal lottery-like stocks are mispriced. This conclusion, however, relies on asset pricing models which might suffer from the joint hypothesis problem: That is, abnormal returns can reflect market inefficiencies, a bad asset pricing model or both. I contribute to the discussion by examining lottery-type assets on the European betting market. Compared to stock markets, betting markets offer the advantage that no asset pricing model is necessary to test market efficiency because outcomes are observable at a terminal point. I use a unique data set of soccer odds covering both a betting exchange and the bookmaker market. The findings reveal a favorite-longshot bias in both market structures confirming the findings from previous literature that lottery-type assets are mispriced. An expected utility model and a prospect theory model confirm that the favorite-longshot bias on the betting exchange is due to misperception of probabilities rather than risk-love. Although bookmakers also bias odds there is evidence that bookmakers are rational in protecting themselves from adverse selection and/or in increasing their turnover. This conclusion is supported by further analysis on the tennis betting market. © 2019 Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois",10.1016/j.qref.2019.05.016,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85071476341&doi=10.1016%2fj.qref.2019.05.016&partnerID=40&md5=3fc699136571112bc209427fcb78d0b6,SCOPUS,Si,Puede usarse para el calculo de la cuota teniendo en cuenta las casas de apuestas tradicionales con los mercados de intercambio de apuestas,ROI,Logistic Regression,Fútbol,"liga española, premiere league, Ligue 1(francia), Serie A, Bundesliga",masculino,No,"Conversión de cuotas de apuestas en probabilidades implícitas, ajuste de datos de apuestas, normalización de probabilidades, análisis de sesgo favorito-longshot, validación cruzada en mercados de intercambio y casas de apuestas tradicionales",32551 partidos,"Cuotas de apuestas de mercados tradicionales y de intercambio, distribución de apuestas entre favoritos y longshots, sesgo de los apostadores, sesgo en casas de apuestas, presencia de oportunidades de arbitraje estadístico",público,http://www.football-data.co.uk/,Evaluar si los participantes del mercado de apuestas de fútbol malinterpretan probabilidades y si existe un sesgo sistemático en favor de apuestas de tipo lotería,Eficiencia de las apuestas,Se confirmó la existencia del sesgo favorito-longshot tanto en mercados de intercambio como en casas de apuestas tradicionales,Datos de múltiples casas de apuestas y mercados de intercambio como Betfair,"2006/07, 2013/14",Maximilian Franke,,"Aunque el estudio proporciona evidencia convincente del sesgo favorito-longshot, depende de datos de apuestas históricas sin incorporar información en vivo"
,Semi-strong inefficiency in the fixed odds betting market: Underestimating the positive impact of head coach replacement in the main European soccer leagues,"In this paper we analyse the efficiency of the sports betting market, seeking to ascertain whether the market is efficient in the case of fixed odds provided by bookmakers in the four major European soccer leagues under the semi-strong efficiency hypothesis. By examining the trends of odds in the event of a major change in expectations about team results, i.e. when the head coach of a team is replaced, we attempt to verify the argument that a profitable strategy for the bettor is likely to be possible. In this case, the market under consideration would be inefficient. Analysing the average effect of head coach replacement, we find a positive impact on team performance. Based on this information, we build a betting strategy to find out whether the bookmakers’ odds absorb this change in expectations about the winning probability of involved teams. Comparing our strategy result with a distribution generated in a Monte Carlo experiment, we conclude that the betting market is inefficient in its semi-strong form. © 2018 Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois",10.1016/j.qref.2018.08.007,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85052788557&doi=10.1016%2fj.qref.2018.08.007&partnerID=40&md5=36ec850dc932a18bbc25527a5ea4c642,SCOPUS,Si,Se busca optimizar cuotas,ROI,Montecarlo simulation,Fútbol,"liga española, premiere league, Serie A, Bundesliga",masculino,No,"Conversión de cuotas de apuestas en probabilidades implícitas, normalización de datos, aplicación de simulaciones Monte Carlo para evaluar la eficiencia del mercado",8676 partidos,"Cuotas de apuestas de casas de apuestas, resultados de partidos, cambios de entrenador en medio de la temporada, variaciones en el rendimiento tras el cambio de entrenador",público,https://www.transfermarkt.com/ http://www.football-data.co.uk/,Evaluar si las casas de apuestas subestiman sistemáticamente el impacto positivo de los cambios de entrenador en el rendimiento del equipo y si esto permite estrategias de apuestas rentables,Bet result,Se encontró que los equipos que cambiaron de entrenador experimentaron un aumento promedio del 24% en su rendimiento,https://www.transfermarkt.com/ http://www.football-data.co.uk/,"2008/09, 2013/14","Giovanni Bernardo, Massimo Ruberti, Roberto Verona",,"Aunque los hallazgos indican una ineficiencia en el mercado de apuestas, la estrategia de inversión en equipos con nuevos entrenadores depende de un número relativamente pequeño de partidos"
,Predicting sports results using latent features: A case study,"Predicting sports results is normally a challenging task, even more in case of a sport that shows a highly stochastic nature. In football, for example, numerous features are tracked and combined with expert knowledge, yielding various predicting algorithms. Our work however, is based on a case where there is no expert knowledge available and the only data comes from previous match results. We built a goal score prediction model that uses latent features obtained from matrix factorization process. We also added a Naive Bayes Classifier to be able to predict outcome of the match. The algorithm has been tested on results of the FIFA World Cup 2014. We also built a match result predictor based on the betting quotas. As these are derived from a complex algorithms that encompass also the expert knowledge, our algorithm can be used to estimate accuracy of an expert knowledge-based system. This case study shows that there is no significant difference between the two algorithms that we tested and that the latent features may provide a valid substitute for real features, when the later ones are not available.",10.1109/MIPRO.2015.7160470,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7160470,IEEE,Si,Uso de calculos matriciales de los resultados del futbol y lo compara con las cuotas,Accuracy,Matrix Factorization,Fútbol,Mundial,masculino,No,"Normalización de datos, modelado de características latentes a partir de resultados de partidos, exclusión de datos de prórrogas y penales",120 partidos,"Goles anotados por cada equipo, cuotas de apuestas de bwin, matriz de goles concedidos y marcados, modelos de predicción basados en características latentes",público,"fifa.com, bwin.com",Evaluar si un modelo basado en factores latentes extraídos mediante matrix factorization puede predecir resultados de partidos de fútbol con precisión similar a las cuotas de apuestas,Victoria o Derrota,"Se logró una precisión del 50% con el modelo basado en matrix factorization, similar a la obtenida con un clasificador Naïve Bayes basado en cuotas de apuestas","fifa.com, bwin.com",2014/15,Stefan Dobravec,,"El dataset es pequeño (64 partidos de la Copa del Mundo), lo que limita la validez de los resultados"
Rafadom,Performance analysis of switching defense to ball screens in the fourth quarter of close Euroleague matches,"Adopting a defensive strategy of switching to ball screens (pick and roll) has become increasingly prevalent in contemporary basketball. This study evaluated the technical and tactical aspects of defensive actions when encountering ball screen offenses, identifying key factors influencing success or failure in defending the pick and roll, particularly in crucial moments during the fourth quarter of close Euroleague matches. A comprehensive analysis of forty-five games from the 2023–2024 Euroleague championship revealed an average end-of-game score difference of 4.42 ± 2.7 points. A total of 452 pick and roll actions were evaluated, where the defense opted for switching, leading to a mismatch scenario. Factors such as the initial defense on the ball-handler before the switch, the technique employed by the screener's defender upon switching onto the ball-handler, defensive strategies for handling outside and inside mismatches, the approach of the ball-handler's defender when switching onto the screener, and the effectiveness of the switch in determining the outcome of the pick and roll action were examined. The findings underscored that switching to counter-pick and roll offenses was the most commonly deployed defensive tactic (52%), showcasing a high success rate, particularly towards the end of the games (56.4%). Notably, the winners performed a switch over the screen by the ball-handler’s defender more frequently (55.3%, χ2 = 5.042, p < .05), followed by a defensive strategy to force the ball-handler to use their weaker hand during outside mismatches (37.3%, χ2 = 9.402, p < .05). Additionally, an aggressive defensive approach involving the screener's defender effectively neutralizing the 3-point shot from the ball-handler (67.8% of total mismatches) and employing a defensive stance in front of the post-up players during inside mismatches demonstrated a success rate of 60.8%, thus proving to be effective defensive strategies against the pick and roll. This study found no significant correlation between the effectiveness of defensive switches and the match's outcome. © JPES.",10.7752/jpes.2024.02052,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85186568199&doi=10.7752%2fjpes.2024.02052&partnerID=40&md5=ee9ef1343297af0ea36810965a94bcf0,SCOPUS,No,Se centra en el analisis tecnico de una jugada de depensa en el baloncesto,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Exploiting sports-betting market using machine learning,"We introduce a forecasting system designed to profit from sports-betting market using machine learning. We contribute three main novel ingredients. First, previous attempts to learn models for match-outcome prediction maximized the model's predictive accuracy as the single criterion. Unlike these approaches, we also reduce the model's correlation with the bookmaker's predictions available through the published odds. We show that such an optimized model allows for better profit generation, and the approach is thus a way to ‘exploit’ the bookmaker. The second novelty is in the application of convolutional neural networks for match outcome prediction. The convolution layer enables to leverage a vast number of player-related statistics on its input. Thirdly, we adopt elements of the modern portfolio theory to design a strategy for bet distribution according to the odds and model predictions, trading off profit expectation and variance optimally. These three ingredients combine towards a betting method yielding positive cumulative profits in experiments with NBA data from seasons 2007–2014 systematically, as opposed to alternative methods tested. © 2019 International Institute of Forecasters",10.1016/j.ijforecast.2019.01.001,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85061670248&doi=10.1016%2fj.ijforecast.2019.01.001&partnerID=40&md5=38ed431f169431d8c0ec3da9b9f6ded2,SCOPUS,Si,Prediccion de apuestas usando CNNs,"Accuracy, ROI","CNN, Logistic Regression",Baloncesto,NBA,masculino,No,"Normalización de estadísticas de jugadores y equipos, transformación de cuotas de apuestas en probabilidades implícitas, eliminación de partidos sin datos completos",985 partidos,"Estadísticas de jugadores y equipos por partido (puntos, asistencias, robos, pérdidas, eficiencia ofensiva y defensiva), cuotas de apuestas de Pinnacle Sports",público,Pinnacle Sports y fuentes oficiales de estadísticas de la NBA,Diseñar un sistema de predicción basado en redes neuronales para generar beneficios en el mercado de apuestas deportivas explotando errores en las probabilidades asignadas por las casas de apuestas,Score,Se logró un ROI positivo del 1.63% utilizando la estrategia óptima de portafolio,"Pinnacle Sports (cuotas de apuestas), estadísticas oficiales de la NBA","2007/08, 2013/14","Ondřej Hubáček, Gustav Šourek, Filip Železný",,"Aunque el modelo demostró ser rentable, depende de la estabilidad de las cuotas de apuestas en Pinnacle Sports, lo que podría no replicarse en mercados más restrictivos"

Long-term rowing performance development in male Olympic and World Championship medal winners compared with nonmedalists. J Strength Cond Res 37(9): e521-e526, 2023 - The purpose of this study was, first, to investigate individual longitudinal 2,000 m rowing ergometer performance (2,000 erg) development of world class male rowers from the beginning of their career until reaching the elite level and to compare ELITE performance development with those who did not reach podium places and, second, to provide 2,000 erg milestones for talent prediction in rowing. Individual annual 2,000 erg performances of 54 male rowers were analyzed from age 15 and throughout their career. Olympic or World Championships medal winners (ELITE; n = 11) were compared with those who did not reach international podium places. Two thousand erg increased (p ≤ 0.05) until the age of 24 in ELITE, while plateaued earlier for less successful rowers. No differences in the rate of performance improvement were found between ELITE and lower performers (p > 0.05). At the age of 20, performance between ELITE and international level nonmedal winners reached significant difference (480.7 ± 20.9 W vs. 435.3 ± 33.9 W, respectively) and remained different onwards (p ≤ 0.05). However, the average of the 10 best seasons cross-sectional performances of less successful rowers were significantly higher until age 18, compared with ELITE. ELITE rowers were able to improve their 2,000 erg performance to higher age; therefore, it is difficult to predict elite performers in junior rowers. Cross-sectional performances of less successful rowers may indicate temporary high-level performers, who might not be able to advance the elite level. © 2022 National Strength and Conditioning Association.",10.1519/JSC.0000000000004479,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85168804359&doi=10.1519%2fJSC.0000000000004479&partnerID=40&md5=eb7829a4679426ad6947f6ae0d4d9eb2,SCOPUS,No,Desarrollo del rendimientos de los jugadores en remo olimpico,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Rafadom,Professional clubs as platforms in multi-sided markets in times of COVID-19: The role of spectators and atmosphere in live football,"In-stadium spectators affect the emotional value and atmosphere of sport live broadcasts. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, in Europe, the presence of in-stadium spectators, however, was suspended until further notice. Conceptualizing professional clubs as economic platforms, network effects due to the lack of in-stadium spectators may affect stakeholders’ utility. Thus, the main aims of this study are to examine the influence of missing in-stadium spectators for professional clubs by investigating network effects on (1) TV viewers’ emotional arousal and (2) TV viewers’ attention towards sponsor messages during live football broadcasts. Using a quantitative research design, a controlled lap was conducted, and broadcasts were presented to n = 26 highly involved participants. Heart rate, eye-tracking, and betting odds data served as measurements of arousal, attention, and game outcome uncertainty and were aggregated on a second-by-second basis (k = 140,400). Multi-level regression analysis showed significant differences in viewers’ arousal and attention to spon-sors, contingent on the presence of in-stadium spectators and game outcome uncertainty. The presence of in-stadium spectators increased arousal, while attention towards sponsor messages de-creased, depending on game outcome uncertainty. Based on the presence of network effects, implications to sustainably adapting professional football clubs’ business models based on stakeholders’ different interests can be given. © 2021 by the authors.

Rafadom,Sponsor message processing in live broadcasts—A pilot study on the role of game outcome uncertainty and emotions,"Live sport broadcasts can evoke emotions in consumers and allow companies to reach their audience in environments that allow for automatic processing of brand messages. However, only few studies have applied psychophysiological methodologies to assess how the live nature of a competition and viewers' emotions affect the processing of sponsor messages, and prior research has mostly relied on ex-post data. Therefore, to identify the interplay of game outcome uncertainty, viewers' emotions and attention to sponsor messages, this exploratory lab study tracks continuous viewer data during live sport broadcasts. Soccer fans' (n = 11) arousal, emotional valence, and visual attention to sponsors while watching live soccer broadcasts were measured using galvanic skin response, video-based facial expressions, and infrared eye-tracking. In-play betting odds served as an indicator of outcome uncertainty. Multi-level modeling reveals that greater outcome uncertainty increases arousal and the magnitude of emotional response. Further, the data reveal that low-to-moderate arousal and valence-neutral emotional states increase viewer attention to sponsor messages. This study is the first to consider the dynamics of live sports experiences in the explanation of sponsorship effectiveness. It contributes to the literature by using continuous measurements involving psychophysiological data to investigate emotions and attention to sponsors. © 2021 The Authors.

Rafadom,Students with Visual Impairments and Sports Betting The Role of the Media,"With many groups at-risk of gambling, some scholars have recommended research into people with hearing loss and others with similar disabilities. Yet, people with visual impairments (VIs) and their sports betting activities have eluded scholarship. Drawing on interdisciplinary studies and interviews with six student–teachers with VIs contributed to analyzing their engagement in betting activities, using mass media and discussions on sports, particularly football. Despite media being a possible influencer on their betting research, the students mostly depend on pundits’ discussions of sporting events from different media outlets, which inform their final choices to stake their sports bet. Findings show that beyond their usual financial attraction, those visually impaired fancy the “bragging rights” of satisfying their supremacy over the sighted people into sporting betting on campus. Results indicate they strongly rely on sports pundits’ discussions alongside the specialized app on their mobile phones to make informed decisions on their bets. The study is fascinating as it explains the strategies of the students by constantly relying on multiple media information to facilitate their sports betting activities as they mostly win more than the sighted. © 2025 selection and editorial matter, Unwana Samuel Akpan; individual chapters, the contributors.",10.4324/9781003462156-9,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85201349644&doi=10.4324%2f9781003462156-9&partnerID=40&md5=2a802169e90ea7f537a8985bf093a4ae,SCOPUS,No,Se centra en como las personas ciegas hacen predicciones deportivas,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,The relationship between game success indicators in the FIFA World Cup – Qatar 2022: An elastic-net regularization approach,"Background and Study Aim The significance of analyzing statistical indicators is paramount, as they provide valuable insights into the distinguishing performance factors of teams. The purpose of this study: 1) to identify statistically significant differences between relevant performance factors among winning, drawing, and losing teams in the 2022 Football World Cup in Qatar; 2) explore indicators that are most strongly associated with the game results in this tournament. Material and Methods A total of 64 matches and 32 participating teams were analyzed. The variables included in the research were: total shots, shots on target, shots off target, effectiveness, passes, passes completed, crosses, crosses against, offsides committed, offsides received, fouls received, ball possession, fouls committed, corners, corners against, yellow cards and red cards. The results are extracted from the official FIFA website. The Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and the ordinal logistic regression with elastic net were used for data calculation. Results The results indicate that winning teams have statistically significantly higher mean values of variables related to goals scored: total shots (p < 0.05), shots on target (p < 0.01), and effectiveness (p < 0.01). According to the information-based model selection criteria AIC (Akaike information criterion) and BIC (Bayesian information criterion) effectiveness and shots on target are the most important variables regarding game results. They, along with corners, are best associated with successful teams. In contrast, crosses, ball possession, corners against, and yellow cards are associated with less successful teams. Results suggest that teams with high ball possession and large number of crosses, but fewer shots on target, have weaker results than teams with more shots on target and less ball possession. Conclusions The study underscores the significance of certain performance indicators, such as total shots, shots on target, and effectiveness, in predicting a team’s success. These findings provide valuable insights for coaches and teams to focus on specific aspects of their game to enhance their chances of winning. Additionally, understanding the impact of variables like ball possession, crosses, corners, and yellow cards emphasizes the importance of a well-rounded strategy for achieving success in international football tournaments. © Armend Myftiu, Agron Thaqi, 2023.",10.15561/26649837.2023.0605,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85182186625&doi=10.15561%2f26649837.2023.0605&partnerID=40&md5=fad50d62e46dd24f4b7d91ee9de8f1ff,SCOPUS,Si,"Analiza indicadores estadisticos clave en la copa del mundo de 2022 y hace una comparación con los resultados de los partidos, util para hacer prediccion","Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC)","Logistic Regression, Elastic Net",Fútbol,Mundial,masculino,No,"Estandarización de variables, transformación logarítmica de algunas variables (offsides y tarjetas amarillas), eliminación de tiempos extra, normalización de datos de posesión y efectividad de tiros",64 partidos,"Tiros totales, tiros a puerta, tiros fuera, efectividad de tiros, pases completados, posesión de balón, faltas recibidas, tarjetas amarillas y rojas, saques de esquina a favor y en contra, fueras de juego cometidos y sufridos",público,web oficial de FIFA,"Identificar los factores estadísticos que diferencian a los equipos ganadores, empatadores y perdedores",Victoria o Derrota,Se encontró que los equipos ganadores tienen significativamente más tiros a puerta (p < 0.01) y mayor efectividad en tiros (p < 0.01) que los equipos que empatan o pierden,FIFA,2022/23,"Armend Myftiu, Agron Thaqi",,"El análisis se basa en una muestra limitada de 64 partidos, lo que puede hacer que los hallazgos no sean generalizables a otros torneos"

Rafadom,"A Simple, Solid, and Reproducible Baseline for Bridge Bidding AI","Contract bridge, a cooperative game characterized by imperfect information and multi-agent dynamics, poses significant challenges and serves as a critical benchmark in artificial intelligence (AI) research. Success in this domain requires agents to effectively cooperate with their partners. This study demonstrates that an appropriate combination of existing methods can perform surprisingly well in bridge bidding against WBridge5, a leading benchmark in the bridge bidding system and a multiple-time World Computer-Bridge Championship winner. Our approach is notably simple, yet it outperforms the current state-of-the-art methodologies in this field. Furthermore, we have made our code and models publicly available as open-source software. This initiative provides a strong starting foundation for future bridge AI research, facilitating the development and verification of new strategies and advancements in the field. © 2024 IEEE.",10.1109/CoG60054.2024.10645547,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85203497957&doi=10.1109%2fCoG60054.2024.10645547&partnerID=40&md5=8fa48f3cdbc4fc5f4770c845bd247d85,SCOPUS,No,IA orientada a un juego de cartas,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Rafadom,Forecasting number of corner kicks taken in association football using compound Poisson distribution,"This article presents a holistic compound Poisson regression model framework to forecast number of corner kicks taken in association football. Corner kick taken events are often decisive in the match outcome and inherently arrive in batch with serial clustering pattern. Providing parameter estimates with intuitive interpretation, a class of compound Poisson regression including a Bayesian implementation of geometric-Poisson distribution are introduced. With a varying shape parameter, the corner counts serial correlation between matches is handled naturally within the Bayesian model. In this study, information elicited from cross-market betting odds was used to improve the model predictability.

Rafadom,1 versus 1 in football after 20 years,"The new millennium was marked by the epic of the legendary Barcelona of Guardiola, the coach who revolutionized the world of football with his tiki taka. This game is made of fast ball exchanges, continuous changes of position and search for the free space to occupy but it has downgraded the dribbling, that is one of the main technical skills of the game of football. Starting from football schools, it almost seems that 1vs1 has been set aside to favour other fundamental techniques, so we find ourselves in a period where fewer and fewer players take the responsibility to try a bet in 1v1, but prefer to pass the ball to the closest mate. This research has analysed the goals of final stages of two World cup (the most football event),20 years later, Russian 2018 and France 1998 and has demonstrated that in 20 years, the incidence of goals scored after a dribble influenced by the action has decreased of 10%. From the round of 16 onwards of Russian 2018 have been scored 47 goals, whose 8 after an influential dribbling (17%). In France 1998 have been scored 45 goals, 12 with an influential dribbling (27%).

Rafadom,THE STARS ARE (RE)ALIGNING: EXTENDING TITLE IX TO NCAA CONFERENCE REALIGNMENT IN THE NIL ERA,"Almost fifty years after Congress enacted Title IX, the NCAA adopted its interim Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) policy, permitting college athletes to be compensated for use of their NIL. While some athletes gain significantly from the NIL regime, most athletes do not capture its benefits. Further, earnings under the NIL regime are distinctly stratified between men's and women's sports. The vast majority of NIL money flows to football and men's basketball. Athletes in other programs-especially women's sports-struggle to find space in the NIL market. Today, the NCAA is approaching a groundbreaking settlement that will reshape the NIL system. If finally approved, the proposed settlement in House v. NCAA, a class action lawsuit challenging the NCAA's prior prohibition on compensating athletes for use of their NIL, will create two significant changes. First, universities will be allowed to facilitate NIL deals between student athletes and third parties. Second, universities will be allowed to participate in a revenue sharing program in which they can directly pay student athletes a portion of the schools' annual athletic revenue, including money from television broadcast rights. Conference realignment, the process by which universities reorganize themselves into different athletic conferences for financial gain by bargaining for larger television broadcast deals, will amplify gendered consequences of the NIL regime and any inequities arising from the post-House revenue sharing system. Conference realignment will expose the NIL ""winners""to larger media markets while imposing travel-based ""human costs""on the NIL ""losers,""who are unable to offset these costs by generating NIL money. Likewise, by increasing the revenue schools receive from selling their broadcast rights, conference realignment will directly impact inequities in revenue sharing earnings between male and female athletes. This Comment explores the effects of NCAA conference realignment on student athletes in the NIL era and emphasizes that these effects should be considered when implementing a revenue sharing system like that proposed in the House settlement. This Comment argues that by exacerbating sex-based disparities baked into the current NIL regime and likely to be perpetuated by future policies, universities' conference realignment decisions constitute disparate impact discrimination under Title IX. These decisions disproportionately impact female athletes by exacerbating NIL earning disparities and neglecting to consider travel-based costs for female athletes. Universities do not engage in conference realignment out of educational necessity, but rather to maximize profits generated from contracts for television broadcast rights. To ameliorate the gendered impacts of conference realignment, this Comment urges the NCAA to address the underlying gender disparities in the NIL regime. In doing so, this Comment analyzes the proposed House settlement and recommends that the House settlement confront looming Title IX problems by creating a revenue sharing system for university-facilitated NIL and athletic revenue based on Title IX's proportionate equality standard. © 2024 University of Wisconsin Law School.

,Market efficiency and the Greek fixed-odds betting market,"Purpose: The purpose of this study is to empirically examine the efficiency of Greek fixed-odds (offline) betting market as offered by OPAP for the period 2016–2019. Design/methodology/approach: Using a four-year data sample of OPAP's opening and closing odds for football matches from all over the world and applying linear probability and probit models, the market efficiency is examined and the existence of possible anomalies is investigated. Findings: The main findings of research suggest that although the odds are dominated primarily by favorite-longshot bias and secondarily by draw bias, this mispricing cannot prove profitable. However, the opening odds, the margin levels and the market structure provide information that is not fully captured by the closing odds, giving bettors profit opportunities. Thus, findings show that the semi-strong market efficiency is questionable. Finally, competition reduces commissions leading to more efficient odds. Practical implications: The conclusions of this study are useful for football betting market and, particularly, for government authorities, bookmakers and bettors. Findings can be extended in future research to prediction tasks. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study about the Greek football betting market. The contribution to the literature lies on the one hand in the examination of a monopolistic land-based betting market, which is being squeezed and threatened by the more competitive online betting market, and on the other hand in the simultaneous examination of the opening and closing odds. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.",10.1108/EMJB-01-2021-0014,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85114188069&doi=10.1108%2fEMJB-01-2021-0014&partnerID=40&md5=cfcab39bfe25d45678b185450d2c6c19,SCOPUS,Si,Habla de la eficiencia del mercado de cuotas de las temporadas 2016 a 2019 de Grecia usando modelos de probabilidad lineal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rafadom,Pre-shot combinations and game-related statistics discriminating between winners and losers depending on the game location during the NBA COVID-19 season,"Basketball in performance depends on numerous factors, where a stable trend was identified by winning teams with better performances in shooting effectiveness and rebounding. However, there is a need for a better understanding of pre-shot combinations that lead to these performance trends. This study aimed to analyze NBA teams’ game-related statistics, pre-shooting combinations, and pick-and-roll differences between winning and losing teams (considering the context: playing at home, away, or in a neutral court) during the COVID-19 season. A retrospective cross-sectional study on the 2019–2020 NBA season (906 games) was carried out. Game-related statistics were gathered from the private company InStat (https://basketball.instatscout.com/). The discriminant analysis and binary logistic regression models were run in order to discriminate the most important features of winning teams depending on the game location. The results showed that defensive rebounds and three-point shooting percentage remained the most important variables that best discriminated winners and losers independently of the game location context. The main results showed that winning teams had a better shooting percentage based on three-pointers, catch-and-shot actions, cuts, pick-and-roll efficacy, and uncontested shots based on a better collective behavior after a successful space creation dynamic through a tactical functional unit. At the same time, teams would need players with the ability to clear those possessions in which the opponents force to an isolation or a contested shot. From a practical application perspective, coaches should focus on composing a team with good shooters, skilled players in isolations, and a good game-time pick-and-roll strategy.

Rafadom,Moroccan ultra groups of football: from Tifos to street politics,"The ultras phenomenon has become the most spectacular form of football fandom in the early twenty-first century. Yet, since their appearance in Morocco, they have been associated with violence and vandalism. This chapter aims to explain the political dimension of the Moroccan ultra group in terms of their chants in Morocco in the post-February 20, 2011 era. It seeks to analyze their narratives which have shifted to a form of social Hirak, or, using Asef Bayat’s term, non-movement. The chapter focuses on the dynamics of two nationally, and universally notorious, groups located in Casablanca, Morocco’s biggest and most densely populated city, namely the “Winners” (supporters of the Wydad Athletic Club) and the “Green Boys” (supporters of the Raja Club Athletic) of Casablanca. The chapter adopts a critical perspective analysis that attempts to sketch out some examples of their “political” chants to understand their discourses, spaces of their activities, levels of their impact on the street protests, and their prospects in the political scene. It also seeks to deconstruct the concept of “social movement” while referring to the Ultras as well as discussing their political transition. © The Editor and Contributors Severally 2024.",10.4337/9781035312696.00016,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85206209079&doi=10.4337%2f9781035312696.00016&partnerID=40&md5=7c8c813da8def9898f4b3fb3a66124f1,SCOPUS,No,Se centra en los mivimientos ultras de marruecos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rafadom,A Bayesian quest for finding a unified model for predicting volleyball games,"Volleyball is a team sport with unique and specific characteristics. We introduce a new two-level hierarchical Bayesian model which accounts for these volleyball-specific characteristics. In the first level, we model the set outcome with a simple logistic regression model. Conditionally on the winner of the set, in the second level, we use a truncated negative binomial distribution for the points earned by the losing team. An additional Poisson-distributed inflation component is introduced to model the extra points played in the case that the two teams have a point difference less than two points. The number of points of the winner within each set is deterministically specified by the winner of the set and the points of the inflation component. The team-specific abilities and the home effect are used as covariates on all layers of the model (set, point and extra inflated points). The implementation of the proposed model on the Italian SuperLega 2017-2018 data shows exceptional reproducibility of the final league table and satisfactory predictive ability.",10.1111/rssc.12436,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/rssc.12436,WOS,No,Se centra extrictamente en el calculo de resultados de partidos de voleibol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Rafadom,DETECTION OF FIXED FOOTBALL MATCHES BASED ON THE THEORY OF CONFORMAL PREDICTORS USING THE MODIFIED STEPANETS INDICATOR FUNCTION,"An urgent issue of modern football competitions is the detection of fixed matches. Known methods for predicting the outcome of a match by analyzing bets on a match or analyzing the actions of football players on the field use a large amount of data that is not always available. To overcome this obstacle, there can be applied a method for detecting suspicious fixed match results based on conformal predictors and power martingales, which uses publicly available public data. But in practice, this method does not always detect such matches with high precision. An improved method for determining a suspicious match is proposed, based on the theory of conformal predictors using a modified Stepanets indicator function, which is compared with a threshold. The modified Stepanets indicator function is applied to the power martingale and shows the relative change in the martingale value of the current match compared to the previous match. The threshold value was determined experimentally according to the criterion of the maximum of the F1 metric. Data from the 2013–2014 season of the French II League were used as a training sample, and data from the 2014–2015 season of Serie B in Italy were used as a test sample. Team clustering was performed on all samples. For each of the formed classes of matches on both samples, the measure of non-conformity, the degree of non-conformity, the power martingale, and the modified Stepanets indicator function were calculated. The resulting indicators of precision metrics and F1 are higher (average values of metrics P = 0.84, F1 = 0.87) than the same indicators of martingale and p-value rules (average values of metrics P = 0.75, F1 = 0.78), applied to the same data. The proposed method reveals 4 out of 5 matches of the 2014–2015 Serie B season in Italy, which are considered fixed according to information from official Italian law enforcement sources © 2023, Authors.

Rafadom,This Time With Feeling: In-Play Sports Betting as a Vehicle for Emotion Regulation,"Objective: The purpose of this research was to assess factors (i.e., emotion regulation, impulsivity) that motivate in-play sports betting. Specifically, we examined whether individuals report increased excitement after placing an in-play bet and whether trait negative and positive urgency moderate the effect of emotion regulation motives on in-play betting frequency. Method: Three cross-sectional studies were conducted, each following a major sporting event: Superbowl LVI (56) (Study 1), MarchMadness Final (Study 2), and Union of European Football Associations Champions League Final (Study 3). Participants were U.S. (NStudy 1 = 111; NStudy 2 = 121) and U.K. (NStudy 3 = 239) residents who reported placing at least one in-play bet during the respective sporting events. Participants completed self-report measures of excitement, emotion regulation motives, in-play betting frequency, problem gambling, and trait affective impulsivity. Data from the three studies were pooled to conduct an integrative data analysis (IDA). Results: Participants reported increased excitement after placing an in-play bet (p <.001). In bivariate analyses, greater emotion regulation motives were associated with greater in-play betting frequency (p <.05). In moderation analyses, emotion regulation motives interacted with trait negative (p <.001) and positive urgency (p <.001) to predict in-play betting frequency, such that the bivariate effects were amplified among those higher (relative to lower) in trait affective impulsivity. Conclusions: In-play sports betting is an exciting activity that people who gamble may engage in to regulate their emotions. These effects are amplified in those with high trait affective impulsivity.Responsible gambling tools such as mandatory play breaks may discourage the continuation of impulsive betting episodes. © 2023 American Psychological Association",10.1037/adb0000966,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85180373706&doi=10.1037%2fadb0000966&partnerID=40&md5=5e20258755c7debf78558b2cec5dfa65,SCOPUS,No,Factores psicologicos en apuestas deportivas en vivo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rafadom,FOOTBALL BETTING AMONG UNIVERSITY STUDENTS IN GHANA,"Football is a popular sport among young people across Africa, incited by the heavy presence of European football that has become central to youth cultures, everyday social routines, forms of consumption and opportunities for establishing social status. A growing body of evidence suggests increasing trends in harmful gambling behaviours in African youth, while the proliferation of football betting particularly remains a critical potential risk for negative mental health outcomes among young people in Sub-Saharan Africa. This chapter draws on original empirical data from a web-based cross-sectional survey to examine the prevalence estimates and associations of socio-demographic and behavioural factors with football betting among young adults attending university in Ghana. It draws on a multivariable logistic regression model to assess the associations with football betting. Our findings point not only to the growing salience of football betting among male demographics, but also the role of peer culture, alcohol and media as predominant sources of participants’ initiation of football betting. Moreover, participants indicated the motive ‘to make money’ as their single major motivation, which raises the prospect that football betting is used as a means to mitigate the adverse effects of unemployment. Overall, the study points to a need for harm prevention strategies that align more closely with public health approaches focused on students, their families, their communities and their universities/ schools. © 2024 by Emerald Publishing Limited.",10.1108/S1476-285420230000018007,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85190087409&doi=10.1108%2fS1476-285420230000018007&partnerID=40&md5=1177be15492ac26809d8621b1430c58f,SCOPUS,No,Impacto psicologico en las apuestas en los estudiantes universitarios en ghana,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To narrow this gap, we propose a way of leveraging the Proximal Policy Optimization using the information provided by the simulator for official RoboCup matches. To do this, our algorithm uses a mix of raw, computed and internally generated data. The final result is a sprinting and a stopping behavior that work in tandem to bring the agent from point a to point b in a very short time. The sprinting speed stabilizes at around 2.5 m/s, which is a great improvement over current solutions. Both the sprinting and stopping behaviors are remarkably stable. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",10.1007/978-3-030-35699-6_1,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85076895279&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-030-35699-6_1&partnerID=40&md5=0e00ad8676a57e0c727937f0dbfe21f0,SCOPUS,No,Se centra en el aprendizaje por refuerzo de una competicion de robots,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Rafadom,Behind the goal: Exploring the football (soccer) goal net through object biography and creative non-fiction,"Football (soccer) and its extended culture have been studied extensively. In contrast, the goal net, an essential part of the game’s equipment, has undergone very little scrutiny in academic research or creative non-fiction. The goal net consists of a nylon net drawn across a rectangular frame, often supported by angled stanchions. Positioned at parallel ends of a rectangular football pitch, they provide the target for opposing teams in the course of a match. During play, the goal net is regularly transformed from perfunctory piece of sporting equipment into artefact, imbued with narrative and aesthetic meaning. Creative non-fiction is a long-established critical approach and means of exploration of football, its play, its participants, traditions, and stories (see Wilson, 2013; Winner, 2012[2000]; Goldblatt, 2006; Bellos, 2002; and Hornby, 1992). The theory and concepts of object biography posit that objects must be examined as if they, like humans, have or have had a life story (Kopytoff, 1986; see also Brown, 2000; Gosden & Marshall, 1999). Creative non-fiction related to football rarely examines the life stories of those objects employed in the game. This paper employs textual and contextual analyses (See Belsey, 2011; McKee, 2003), theoretical frameworks offered by object biography, and a famous goal in the Népstadion, Hungary, from 1981, to examine the oft-neglected goal net’s dramatic influence on the visual narrative of a key element of football: a goal scored. © 2021, Australasian Association of Writing Programs.

Rafadom,Patterns of daily fantasy sport play: Tackling the issues,"Daily fantasy sports (DFS), a rapidly growing industry, allows players to create fantasy teams of real-life players and potentially win cash prizes, derived from entry fees. Some stakeholders have expressed concern that DFS’s accelerated nature and other features might promote excessive play and related harm. We conducted the first descriptive summary of actual DFS play using records from a cohort of subscribers to a dominant operator, DraftKings. Participants (N = 10,385) initially entered paid National Football League (NFL) contests. Across all participants, players entered a median of two contests per entry day and typically submitted a single entry for each contest they entered. Players paid a median of $87 in entry fees throughout the 2014 NFL season and experienced an overall median net loss of $30.7. However, we identified heavily involved sub-groups of players based on number of contests entered, total entry fees, and net loss. These top 1% groups were less likely to restrict themselves to NFL games, exhibited greater time involvement, but also won a greater percentage of the contests they entered than typical players. Our observations of typical and heavily involved players tend to mirror those generated in previous Internet sports gambling research. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2019.",10.1007/s10899-018-09817-w,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85065078801&doi=10.1007%2fs10899-018-09817-w&partnerID=40&md5=f42bf7e766dbc2b50e3f0e153593cece,SCOPUS,No,Analisis de jugadores del Fantasy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Rafadom,Patterns of numerical relations in goal-scoring possessions of the 2014 FIFA World Cup Winner; [Tendances des relations numériques dans les séquences offensives terminées en but du vainqueur de la Coupe du monde FIFA2014],"Goal scoring has been regarded as the ultimate indicator of offensive success in soccer. Research on patterns that characterize goal-scoring possessions have frequently employed reductionist approaches. This paper aimed to examine the patterns of numerical relations of open-play goal-scoring possessions of the 2014 FIFATM World Cup winner team. We hypothesized that a more unstable distribution of players in goal-scoring possessions Germany would be generated in sub-areas of the effective play-space closer to opponents' goal. We analysed 11video sequences from 6 matches of the German team in this tournament. The uncertainty of teams' numerical advantage within sub-areas of play was calculated for each offensive sequence through Shannon's entropy. We observed higher entropy within Germany's Central Offensive (opponents' Central Defensive) sub-area in comparison with the other sub-areas of play. There is a tendency of the German team to generate numerical instability within locations closer to the opponents' goal, possibly due to the shifting of positions, drawing of opposing defenders towards peripheral areas and the creation of spaces for teammates to exploit within this risky zone to the opposition. © ACAPS, 2021.; La marque d'un but est considérée comme l'indicateur définitif desuccès offensif au football.Larecherche sur les tendances qui caractérisent les séquences terminées en but ont souvent eu recours à des approches réductionnistes. Cet article viseà examiner les tendancesderelations numériques dans les séquences terminées en but du vainqueur de la Coupe du monde FIFA 2014. Nous avons émis l'hypothèse que dans ces séquences l'Allemagne générait une distribution plus instable de joueurs dans les sous-zones de l'espace du jeu plus proche du but adversaire. Nous avons analysé 11séquences vidéo de6 matches de l'équipe allemande dans ce tournoi. L'incertitude de l'avantage numérique des équipes dans les sous-zones de jeu a été calculée par l'entropie de Shannon pour chaque séquence offensive. Nous avons observé une entropie plus élevée au sein de la sous-zone offensive centrale de l'Allemagne (défensive centrale de l'adversaire) en comparaison avec les autres sous-zones dejeu. Il y a une tendance de l'équipe allemande à générer une instabilité numérique dans des endroits plus proches du but adversaire, possiblement en raison du changement de position, de l'attraction des défenseurs adversaires vers les zones périphériques et la création d'espaces à exploiter pour ses coéquipiers dans cette zone risquée pour l'opposition. © 2021 EDP Sciences.

Rafadom,Betting on Australian Rules Football: Can Expert Tipsters beat Randomness?,"Betting on the various codes of football in Australia accounts for the majority of sports betting, with Australian rules football (AFL) by far the most popular sport in Australia. Several studies have revealed the heavy presence of gambling advertising during AFL broadcasts, and a frequently used advertising strategy involves the use of well-known AFL commentators outlining their tips and betting suggestions. To date, no research has examined the hypotheses that skill may help in predicting AFL matches and monetary outcomes from AFL betting. Rather than merely discounting such ideas, it is important to test them empirically. The aims of this study were therefore, to examine if (1) expert AFL tipsters made better predictions than random picks, (2) expert AFL tipsters gained greater monetary reward than random selection, and (3) expert tipsters’ prediction accuracy improved with betting experience. To this end, six seasons of AFL matches, odds data, and expert tipster data were analysed retrospectively, totalling 1141 matches. Random selections were calculated for each match using an inbuilt random number generator within Microsoft Excel and a $2 simulated wager was applied for each AFL match. The results of mixed-effects modelling showed that experts picked more correct outcomes than random selection; experts’ correct predictions were partially mediated by home-game selections; no difference in monetary outcome was observed for experts compared to random selection; experts’ predictions did not improve over time. The results of this study may be used to inform both psychological interventions that target gamblers’ illusions of control, and public health gambling harm prevention messaging. © 2023, Crown.",10.1007/s10899-023-10244-9,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85166935790&doi=10.1007%2fs10899-023-10244-9&partnerID=40&md5=2fcfe5811f894692a4d4d87cc3534166,SCOPUS,No,"Analisis de los ""tips"" de los expertos en la AFL",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Rafadom,NBA Winner Prediction: A Hybrid Framework Incorporating Internal and External Factors,"In recent years, extensive analysis has been applied to predicting NBA game results due to the popularity of basketball and massive financial transactions in NBA betting. The primary objective of this research is to construct a predictive model to precisely forecast the outcome of NBA basketball games in the latest 2020-21 and 2021-22 NBA regular season. We designed features which incorporates both external and internal factors such as teams' Elo rating, average team performance in recent games, home court advantage and tiredness due to back-to-back games. We built up three feature sets and performed feature selection using sequential feature selection (SFS) and recursive feature elimination (RFE) to verify their effectiveness. Results show that novel features such as level of tiredness and difference of Elo ratings between home and away team improves prediction accuracy. To make fair prediction for the latest NBA season, we utilize 10-fold cross validation to train and select models with decent mean accuracy and low standard deviation for final evaluation. It is found that our best random forest model performs fairly well in predicting games in the latest 2020-21 and 2021-22 season with an accuracy of 67.98%. The prediction results and the identification of key features that exert the most significant effects on the results can be helpful and meaningful to different stakeholders in this field, such as team coaches, players and NBA betters.  © 2022 ACM.",10.1145/3538950.3538960,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85135030542&doi=10.1145%2f3538950.3538960&partnerID=40&md5=1eb49b0bb7070b8815d0825b426f6ed0,SCOPUS,No,Machine learning muy repetido,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Rafadom,The Relationship between Betting Propensity as Perceived by Golfers and Exercise Addiction: Verification of Moderating Effects According to Background Variables,"Background: We aimed to verify the effect of betting propensity as perceived by golf participants on exercise addiction, as well as the moderating effects of gender, average number of strokes, weekly exercise frequency, and monthly rounding frequency on these relationships. Methods: The study included 377 individuals who utilized golf driving ranges and courses in Seoul and Gyeonggi Province (Korea) selected using the non-probability sampling method. The data collected thereafter were sub-jected to confirmatory factor analysis, reliability analysis, descriptive statistical analysis, correlation analysis, step-wise regression analysis, and moderating effect analysis using Jamovi version 2.2.2 (University of Newcastle, Sydney, Australia). When the moderating effect was statistically significant, simple linear regression analysis was used to verify the results. Results: Betting propensity had a positive effect on all sub-factors related to exercise addiction (withdrawal symptoms, conflict, attachment, tolerance, and obsessive–compulsive disorder) (P<0.05). Only the average number of stroke exerted a significant moderating effect on these relationships (P<0.05). Specifically, greater perceived betting propensity was associated with a greater propensity for exercise addiction, and this phenomenon was more pronounced among those with a low average number of strokes. Conclusion: The current results suggest that greater perceived betting propensity is associated with an increased risk of exercise addiction among golf participants, especially those who are relatively more skilled. These results highlight the need to emphasize participating for the enjoyment of golf and psychological satisfaction without promoting practices that can lead to exercise addiction, such as betting golf. © 2022 Ji et al.

Rafadom,The analysis of the results of the Olympic free-style wrestling champions,"The successful and effective management of sports training is impossible without the justified forecasting. The retrospective analysis of the sport career of elite sportsmen allows to identify interconnections of the competitions – results on various stages of the sporting career. Analysis of papers showed, there are no researches which would analyse the highest-level sportsmen in wrestling – Olympic champions. Aim of the research – to analyse results of the Olympic champions in wrestling from 1996 to the present day and to discover the main trends and regularities. The analysis included 41 sport careers of winners in freestyle wrestling of the six Olympic Games from 1996 to 2016. The results of wrestlers on international competitions into the four age stages are analysed: the pre-junior age, junior age, senior until the victory at the Olympic Games and a time period after the victory. The majority of the sportsmen (90.3 %) win only once and participate in the OG only once or twice (90.2 %). The retrospective analysis has shown that 48.8 % of wrestlers-champions have performed at the international stage at the cadets age, and 85.4 % of sportsmen at the junior age, over 90 % of them have taken the winning places. Prior to the victory at the Olympic Games 87.8 % of the sportsmen take part at the continental championships, all of them have won medals.

Rafadom,CS Freiburg: coordinating robots for successful soccer playing,"Robotic soccer is a challenging research domain because many different research areas have to be addressed in order to create a successful team of robot players. The paper presents the CS Freiburg team, the winner in the middle-size league at RoboCup 1998, 2000, and 2001. The paper focuses on multiagent coordination for both perception and action. The contributions of the paper are new methods for tracking ball and players observed by multiple robots, team coordination methods for strategic team formation and dynamic role assignment; a rich set of basic skills allowing robots to respond to a large range of situations in an appropriate way, and an action-selection method based on behavior networks, as well as a method to learn the skills and their selection. As demonstrated by evaluations of the different methods and by the success of the team, these methods permit the creation of a multirobot group which is able to play soccer successfully. In addition, the developed methods promise to advance the state of the art in the multirobot field.",10.1109/TRA.2002.804041,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1067991,IEEE,No,Robotica aplicada a futbol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Rafadom,Affective responses to uncertain real-world outcomes: Sentiment change on Twitter,"We use data from Twitter.com to study the interplay between affect and expectations about uncertain outcomes. In two studies, we obtained tweets about candidates in the 2014 US Senate elections and tweets about National Football League (NFL) teams in the 2014/2015 NFL season. We chose these events because a) their outcomes are highly uncertain and b) they attract a lot of attention and feature heavily in the communication on social media. We also obtained a priori expectations for the events from political forecasting and sport betting websites. Using this quasi-experimental design, we found that unexpected events are associated with more intense affect than expected events. Moreover, the effect of expectations is larger for outcomes that fall below expectations than outcomes that exceed expectations. Our results are consistent with fundamental principles in psychological science, such as reference-dependence in experienced affect. We discuss how naturally occurring online data can be used to test psychological predictions and develop novel psychological insights. © 2019 Bhatia et al.

Rafadom,Artificial human swarms outperform vegas betting markets,"Swarm Intelligence (SI) is a natural phenomenon in which biological groups amplify their collective intelligence by forming dynamic systems. It has been studied extensively in bird flocks, fish schools, and bee swarms. In recent years, AI technologies have enabled networked human groups to form systems modeled on natural swarms. Referred to as Artificial Swarm Intelligence or ASI, this approach has been shown to significantly amplify the effective intelligence of human groups. The present study compares the predictive ability of ASI to Vegas betting markets when forecasting sporting events. Groups of average sports fans were required to forecast the outcome of 200 hockey games in the NHL league (10 games per week for 20 weeks). The expected win rate for Vegas favorites was 62% across the 200 games based on the published odds. The ASI system achieved a win rate of 85%. The probability that the ASI system outperformed Vegas by chance was very low (p = 0.006), indicating a significant result. Researchers also compared the ROI generated from two betting models: one that wagered weekly on the top Vegas favorite, and one that wagered weekly on the top ASI favorite. At the end of the 20-week period, the Vegas model generated a 41% financial loss, while the ASI model generated a 170% gain. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.",10.1007/978-3-030-02686-8_54,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85055915528&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-030-02686-8_54&partnerID=40&md5=4e9218c734886d350eacba2745ed72bb,SCOPUS,No,Toca el enjambre artificial que se ha tocado con anterioridad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Rafadom,Analysis of patterns and trends in competition manipulation in sport global data: 2018–2023,"Competition manipulation in sports has evolved from a localized issue to a global concern. Advances in technology and the growth of sports betting markets have attracted criminal networks that manipulate sporting events for financial gain. The aim of this study was to examine patterns and trends in competition manipulation in sport from a global dataset over a 6-year period. Manipulation of sports competition investigations and sanctions were assessed across world regions and sports. The Macolin Convention typology was also employed to categorize manipulation types and instigators. Results showed an increase in investigations and sanctions year-on-year, with Europe consistently having the highest numbers annually. The majority of investigations and sanctions were consistent across the sports of football, cricket, and tennis, and also an emerging trend in sanctions in esports. Investigation types have mostly been due to direct interference of a sports competition or use of external means. The instigator of manipulation trends shifted from opportunistic types to the exploitation of power or influence. The patterns and trends reported can help inform the work of sport management professionals. © 2024 The Author(s).

Rafadom,Detecting drivers of basketball successful games: an exploratory study with machine learning algorithms,"This paper aims to identify the drivers leading to victory for basketball matches in NBA, the american National Basketball Association. Firstly, a dataset containing box scores and Dean's four factors for regular seasons from 2004-2005 to 2017-2018 has been prepared. Then, box scores and four factors have been used as classification independent variables, to predict the winner of matches involving the Golden State Warriors team. Both CART and Random Forests machine learning techniques have been applied, and quality of fitting analyzed. Variable importance of fitted models has been studied to identify success drivers showing how, for Golden State Warriors, defense is a key factor to win a game. At last, these models are shown to be suitable for coaching staff in game preparation, and CART models are shown to be valuable on the basketball court for match interpretation. © 2020 Università del Salento.

Rafadom,SA Rugby Injury and Illness Surveillance and Prevention Project (SARIISPP) Super Rugby Unlocked and the Carling Currie Cup Premiership Competition Injury Surveillance Report 2020/21,"The outbreak of the Coronavirus pandemic (COVID19) resulted in the 2020 Super Rugby competition being suspended in March 2020, at completion of round 7 of the competition, and the 2020 Carling Currie Cup competition did not take place as originally scheduled. Seven South African Rugby franchises returned to official competition on 9 October 2020. The seven franchises first played in a 7-round 2020 Super Rugby Unlocked tournament, after which the winners of this part of the combined tournaments, the Vodacom Blue Bulls, were crowned as the Super Rugby Unlocked Champions. This was followed immediately by a 7-round 2020/21 Carling Currie Cup, with knockout play-off rounds. The points from the Super Rugby Unlocked tournament were carried over into the Carling Currie Cup. This culminated in the Vodacom Blue Bulls also being crowned as the Carling Currie Cup 2020/21 Champions after the final play-off match. As the Super Rugby Unlocked and Carling Currie Cup competitions included the same seven franchises, with no break afforded between competitions, this report presents the combined data from both tournaments. Although the structure of the 2020/21 season was unique, data analysis revealed no apparent reasons for these data to be treated differently to previous seasons' data. As such the collective competition data is referred to as the 'Carling Currie Cup' 2020/21 throughout this report. Despite the disruptions to the 2020 season, and players potentially being unable to maintain the physical qualities necessary to protect themselves against injury, our analysis tells a positive story about how players were managed during these times, with injury rates being comparable to previous seasons' injury rates, and within the expected season-to-season limits of variation for the Carling Currie Cup. As part of the SA Rugby Injury and Illness Surveillance and Prevention Project (SARIISPP), the Carling Currie Cup 2020/21 Premiership Division Competition (the 'Carling Currie Cup') injury data were recorded throughout the tournament by the medical doctors and medical support staff of the respective teams. All seven teams were required to record every match and training injury that occurred in their team. The injury rate of Time-Loss injuries for the Carling Currie Cup 2020/21 was 91 (76 to 106) injuries per 1000 player hours (mean and 95% confidence intervals), which is higher than the international rate of 81 (63 to 105) injuries per 1000 player hours [1], but within the expected limits of season-to-season variation for the Carling Currie Cup. This equates to 1.8 injuries per team per match. The Cell C Sharks had the highest injury rate for Time-Loss injuries for the 2020/21 tournament and this was significantly higher than their 2014-2019 tournament average. Despite having the highest injury rate, the Cell C Sharks had the lowest average severity and thus experienced a low burden of injury. What this means, is that although they had a high number of injuries, they did not lose many days of training and match play due to these injuries. This finding is interesting to note as the Cell C Sharks ranked 2nd in the tournament, and in previous years the teams who ranked in 1st or 2nd positions of the competition had significantly lower injury rates than those who ranked in last position [2]. The Vodacom Blue Bulls, who won both the Super Rugby Unlocked phase of the tournament and the Carling Currie Cup, had a moderate injury rate and average severity, resulting in them experiencing a moderate injury burden as a team. Conversely, the Xerox Golden Lions, who had the second lowest injury rate, had a high average severity of injury resulting in a high injury burden. This means, that although having a low number of injuries, these injuries resulted in many training and match days missed. Although teams may have a low injury rate, injuries of a high severity still represent a sizable burden to the team, resulting in many training and match days lost due to injury for that team. This highlights the importance of collecting severity data, and not simply injury rates on their own. © 2021 The Author(s).",10.17159/2078-516X/2021/v33i1a11849,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85150056922&doi=10.17159%2f2078-516X%2f2021%2fv33i1a11849&partnerID=40&md5=3556ac2e142ea2d98c2746ed66d538e6,SCOPUS,No,Analisis de lesiones de Rugby,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Rafadom,Predicting Risky Decision Making (Odds Selection) in Regular Soccer Gamblers from Nigeria using Cognitive Tasks Combined with Non-Cognitive Measures,"As real time soccer gambling is becoming a game of choice for many Nigerian youths, there is need to examine some predictive factors that could account for risky decision making in the population. We combined some cognitive tasks (memory, concentration, executive function and problem solving) and non-cognitive measures (time taken to complete a bet, years of gambling and addiction tendency measures) to derive a more parsimonious model of predicting risky decision making in this population. Twenty-eight undergraduate students that endorsed regular involvement (at least once a week) in soccer betting and were willing to come to the psychology lab for testing were recruited. Four neuropsychological measures (Craft Story 21: Immediate and delayed, Number Span Test: Forward and backward, Trail Making Test: A&B, Tower of Hannoi and a gambling questionnaire (Gamblers Anonymous Questionnaire) were used for the study. Study design was correlational and linear regression (step wise method) was used for data analysis. Step wise regression statistics yielded nine possible model combinations with high predictive strengths. Overall, model 9 (with adjusted R2 = 0.57) that has 6 measures including one from non-cognitive and 5 from cognitive measures was adjudged to be most parsimonious putting into consideration its predictive strength and number of tasks required. The tasks in our most parsimonious model were: time taken to complete a bet (non-cognitive), Craft Story 21: immediate (cognitive: memory), Number Span Forward: Total correct and longest correct (cognitive: concentration), Trail Making Test: B (cognitive: executive function) and Tower of Hannoi: Time taken to complete (cognitive: problem solving). Pearson product moment correlation between the predictor variables and the dependent variable (number of odds selected) showed inverse correlation of Craft Story Immediate, Number Span total correct and Number span longest correct suggesting strong divergence of these variables to odd selection. Time taken to complete bet, Trail Making Test: B and time taken to complete Tower of Hannoi respectively had positive correlations with number of odds selected. Our results suggest that multiple domains of cognitive abilities and time taken to complete a bet are important for predicting gamblers at risk for poor decision making. It further suggests that use of single task for a particular cognitive domain could be sufficient in predicting persons at risk for decision making. Overall, our study suggests that risky decision making in real time sports betting could be predicted using fewer neuropsychological tasks measuring wider domains of brain behaviour and a non-cognitive measure. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",10.1007/s10899-022-10159-x,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85138693179&doi=10.1007%2fs10899-022-10159-x&partnerID=40&md5=d72ecf765990c629963fa1fd40801cf8,SCOPUS,No,Toma de decisiones arriesgadas a tiempo real en apuestas deportivas,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Rafadom,Actual Problems of Development of Special Endurance of Weightlifters Who Specialize in the Push of Weights on a Long Cycle,"Analysis of the scientific literature has shown that weightlifters who specialize in pushing weights over a long cycle to develop special endurance use the interval method of training in lifting weights. In contrast to this technique, it is proposed to alternate the interval and uniform method, the introduction at the special preparatory stage and in the competitive period of competitive actions in modes-one in a microcycle lasting over 5 minutes and the other during the stage lasting over 10 minutes. Analysis of the protocols of the World Weightlifting Championships for the period from 2016 to 2020 showed that they are the current champions of Ukraine and winners of world championships. The closest results to the standard of the master of sports of the international class are that the athlete of a weight category to 78 kg lacked only 1 rise, athletes of weight categories to 63 and 85 kg did not have enough on the 2 lifts, weight category over 95 kg did not have enough 8 lifts, weight category to 68 lifts was not enough for 68 kg, 13 lifts were not enough for the weight category up to 68 kg, 28 lifts were not enough for the weight categories up to 95 kg. The results of Ukrainian weightlifters remained insufficiently high. This determined the need to explore current issues to improve the training process of the national team of Ukraine in weightlifting. The purpose of the study is to study the effectiveness of methods for developing special endurance weightlifters who specialize in pushing weights over a long cycle and develop exercises that will further qualitatively and professionally perform at world-class competitions. Our study showed that the application of our proposed exercises, duration of approaches, and rest intervals between them have a positive training effect to improve athletic performance, as well as the development of functional training of athletes, which will further contribute to their special endurance in world competitions. © 2022 by authors, all rights reserved.",10.13189/saj.2022.100213,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85129923109&doi=10.13189%2fsaj.2022.100213&partnerID=40&md5=464f9eabc58fe2a52912af4c624ab9c7,SCOPUS,No,Trata sobre el levantamiento de pesos en ucrania,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Rafadom,Analysis of game performance indicators during 2015–2019 world padel tour seasons and their influence on match outcome,"A better understanding of the demands of in-game competition demands may improve coaching strategies, training designs, and injury prevention programs. However, there is limited information regarding performance analysis in professional padel. This study aimed to analyse performance indicators and their influence on match outcomes regarding sex, tournament round, and set number. The sample contained 1070 sets from 532 matches of the 2016 to 2019 World Padel Tour seasons. Variables including sex, round, game result, stroke effectiveness, and break points were registered through systematic observation. A non-parametric approach was applied to evaluate differences between sex, match outcome, and tournament round. The results showed significant differences between winners and losers regarding sex in break points (male d = 2.13, p = 0.00; female d = 2.22, p = 0.00), smash winners (male d = 0.85, p = 0.00; female d = 0.69, p = 0.00), groundstroke winners (male d = 1.01, p = 0.00; female d = 1.18, p = 0.00), volley winners (male d = 1.08, p = 0.00; female d = 0.91, p = 0.00), and errors (male d = 0.76, p = 0.00; female d = 0.65, p = 0.00). Furthermore, differences in shot effectiveness between winners and errors increased in the last set of the match and in the last round of the tournament (p < 0.05). Therefore, shot effectiveness seems to be a key factor in professional padel that distinguishes between winning and losing players. Such knowledge may have implications in the design of appropriate game strategies and specific training sessions to improve performance and to prevent sport injuries. © 2021 by the authors.

Rafadom,Recall and awareness of gambling advertising and sponsorship in sport in the UK: A study of young people and adults,"Background: The impact of gambling advertisements shown during sporting events on young people is an important public health issue. While extensive research has taken place in Australia, there is still only a limited understanding of this issue in the United Kingdom (UK). Method: A mixed methods study was conducted with 71 family groups comprised of 99 young people (8-16 years) and 71 adults recruited at six sites across South London, England (May-July 2018). Interviewer-assisted surveys investigated recall and awareness of sports betting brands using interviews and a magnet placement board activity developed in Australia. Quantitative data were analysed using descriptive statistics, with qualitative data interpreted using thematic analysis techniques. Results: Just under half of young people (n = 46, 46%) and more than two thirds of adults (n = 49, 71%) were able, unprompted, to name at least one gambling brand. Boys had a significantly higher recall of brands than girls, as did young people who watched a lot of football on television. Almost two thirds of young people (n = 63, 63%) correctly placed one or more shirt sponsor magnets next to the corresponding football team, and 30% (n = 30) correctly placed three or more sponsors magnets next to the corresponding football team. Just under two thirds of adults (n = 44, 62%) correctly placed one or more shirt sponsors magnets next to the corresponding football team. Young people recalled seeing gambling advertising on television (n = 78), technology/screens (n = 49), and in association with sports teams (n = 43). Adults recalled seeing advertising on television (n = 56), on technology/screens (n = 37), in sports stadiums (n = 34), and in betting venues (n = 34). Over three quarters of young people (n = 74 out of 95 responses, 78%) and 86% of adults (n = 59 out of 69 responses) thought that betting had become a normal part of sport. Conclusion: In order to reduce the exposure of young people to gambling advertising, policymakers in the UK should consider comprehensive approaches, similar to those applied in tobacco control, which cover all forms of advertising, including promotion and sponsorship. © 2019 The Author(s).",10.1186/s12954-019-0291-9,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85063779739&doi=10.1186%2fs12954-019-0291-9&partnerID=40&md5=b101bcebc4c93f45ff47ce0cec0a23ef,SCOPUS,No,Publicidad de casas de apuestas sobre eventos deportivos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Rafadom,Navigating Between Human and Machine-Based Evaluation: Judgment and Objectivity in Economic Games Exemplified in the Analysis of MMA Fights,"UFC (Ultimate Fighting Championship) video games aim to provide a realistic virtual experience of MMA (Mixed Martial Arts) fights. However, despite the seeming simplicity of the point-based scoring system used during these fights, judges’ holistic verdicts of identifying the winner often fail to accurately reflect the performances because, we find, they do not rely on the point-awarding system used during the fights. We investigate the extent to which judges employ holistic approaches in their scoring decisions, even though they are consistent in applying them. To overcome the shortcomings of the holistic approach, we propose a merit-based set of rules (based on the Bayesian statistical approach that is driven by the points accrued in each round of the fight) for identifying the winners of matches and tournaments. Merit-based sets of rules are commonplace in economic games, in which strategic decision-making and performance evaluation are common, and such rules infer that quantified measures do objectify the assessment of player/fighter performance in a far more satisfactory (and non-controversial) manner. We thereby emphasize the importance of significant strikes being a key component of scoring. Our analysis of data from 3039 UFC decision fights demonstrates that the potential of objective scoring methods will make tournaments more attractive for not only gamers but also spectators. Likewise, such objective evaluation methods are useful in economic games. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.",10.1007/978-3-031-60692-2_16,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85195864470&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-031-60692-2_16&partnerID=40&md5=573de5dd434c2f01acd3b265df8802e2,SCOPUS,No,Puntajes de pelea en la UFC,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Analyzing football betting behavior using prospect theory,"In this study, bets on football matches are taken into consideration and attitudes of bettors towards risk are examined using Prospect Theory. Before the match, the odds of bets are determined by the betting companies (i.e. bookmakers), considering a variety of factors, and bets are presented for people to play. If people are placing on a particular bet, the odds are instantly revised by the bookmakers. These changes are reflected in the system by updating the odds as long as the bets remain open. In the scope of the study, only bets on the result of the match (i.e. the win of the home team, draw and win of the away team) were considered. Accordingly, the people were asked to indicate the odds and possible earnings attracting them to place a bet on a particular result among those three or result in dropping a bet, and the answers were analyzed in accordance with the Prospect Theory principles.",10.5505/pajes.2020.71473,http://dx.doi.org/10.5505/pajes.2020.71473,WOS,Si,Analisis de como los apostadores perciben el riesgo-oportunidad bajo una cuota,,,Fútbol,liga turca,masculino,No,,,"Probabilidad percibida, comportamiento de riesgo",,,Explicar el comportamiento de los apostadores en el deporte mediante la teoría del prospecto,,,,,,,
,"High stakes, experts, and recency bias: evidence from a sports gambling contest","Sports betting markets provide a unique opportunity to test market efficiency and, in this case, study the presence of recency bias and experts in forecasting sports outcomes. This paper uses a panel data set of individual NFL sports gamblers in a season-long contest known as the SuperContest. The contest is used to track the picks of individual gamblers against the spread on games throughout the 2013–18 NFL regular seasons. We find that overall, the SuperContest entrants are no better at picking winners than a coin flip and exhibit a recency bias. However, more skilled contestants are less susceptible to the recency bias and their skill advantage forecasting outcomes may be their avoidance of a recency bias trap. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",10.1080/13504851.2022.2099517,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85134173401&doi=10.1080%2f13504851.2022.2099517&partnerID=40&md5=d9a546ef5b6aa2c87d9c7998a7b39b90,SCOPUS,Si,"Habla sobre si los apostadores tienen habilidades predictivas o simplemente siguen movimientos sesgados, que puede ser relevante para el calculo de cuotas",Win % contra spread,Regression,Fútbol Americano,liga americana,masculino,No,,2690 observaciones de selecciones semanales durante 6 temporadas,"% selección de un equipo en la semana previa, ats del equipo la semana previa, diferencia en puntos ats la semana previa, del equipo y del rival.",No se sabe,,Analizar la eficiencia del mercado de apuestas deportivas,Sesgo en la fijación,Existe sesgo de recencia en la mayoría de apostadores,SuperContest de la NFL ,2013 - 2018,,"- Uso de datos de un concurso real, Estructura de panel de dato,  Análisis del sesgo de recencia","Falta generalizar, limitaciones del dataset"

,Predictive analysis and modelling football results using machine learning approach for English Premier League,"The introduction of artificial intelligence has given us the ability to build predictive systems with unprecedented accuracy. Machine learning is being used in virtually all areas in one way or another, due to its extreme effectiveness. One such area where predictive systems have gained a lot of popularity is the prediction of football match results. This paper demonstrates our work on the building of a generalized predictive model for predicting the results of the English Premier League. Using feature engineering and exploratory data analysis, we create a feature set for determining the most important factors for predicting the results of a football match, and consequently create a highly accurate predictive system using machine learning. We demonstrate the strong dependence of our models’ performances on important features. Our best model using gradient boosting achieved a performance of 0.2156 on the ranked probability score (RPS) metric for game weeks 6 to 38 for the English Premier League aggregated over two seasons (2014–2015 and 2015–2016), whereas the betting organizations that we consider (Bet365 and Pinnacle Sports) obtained an RPS value of 0.2012 for the same period.

,Accumulator bet selection through stochastic diffusion search,"An accumulator is a bet that presents a rather unique payout structure, in that it combines multiple bets into a wager that can generate a total payout given by the multiplication of the individual odds of its parts. These potentially important returns come however at an increased risk of a loss. Indeed, the presence of a single incorrect bet in this selection would make the whole accumulator lose. The complexity of selecting a set of matches to place an accumulator bet on, as well as the number of opportunities to identify winning combinations have both dramatically increased with the easier access to online and offline bookmakers that bettors have nowadays. We address this relatively under-studied combinatorial aspect of sports betting, and propose a binary optimization model for the problem of selecting the most promising combinations of matches, in terms of their total potential payout and probability of a win, to form an accumulator bet. The results of an ongoing computational experiment, in which our model is applied to real data pertaining to the four main football leagues in the world over a complete season, are presented and compared to those of single bet selection methods. © 2019, ICIC International.",10.24507/ijicic.15.02.641,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85067580580&doi=10.24507%2fijicic.15.02.641&partnerID=40&md5=6891f809315465d161eaef32b61c044a,SCOPUS,Si,Modelos de optimizacion binaria para calculos de cuotas,"Expected value, Average betting return",SDS,Fútbol,"liga española, premiere league, Bundesliga, Serie A",masculino,Sí,Se establece un umbral del 25% para seleccionar apuestas,1 temporada de futbol de las 4 ligas mencionadas,"Cuotas de las casas de apuestas, probabilidades de los partidos, y combinación óptima de apuestas",público,,"Modelo para elegir la combinación más óptima de apuestas acumuladas, comparar rentabilidad con apuestas individuales ",Maximizar combinación óptima,37.6% de ganancias con las apuestas combinadas mientras que con las individuales un 30.1% de ganancia.,Resultados de partidos y probabilidades de apuestas obtenidos de bases de datos públicas.,2015/16,,"Modelos matemáticos para seleccionar múltiples apuestas con altas ganancias, aparte del uso de metaheurísticas avanzadas.","No se incluyen otro tipo de datos como lesiones o similares.

,Soccer Strategy Analytics Using Probabilistic Model Checkers,"When it comes to predicting the outcome of soccer matches, there are two main techniques that dominate the betting industry: deep learning and machine learning. However, as with many state-of-the-art applications, these methods often exhibit significant drawbacks. Primarily, they act as black boxes where the internal operations are not transparent, making it difficult to discern the cause when predictions fail. In this paper, we explore the potential of using probabilistic model checkers as an alternative approach for predicting soccer match outcomes. This technique, while unconventional, offers greater transparency or white box visibility into its operations when compared to state-of-the-art methods. The choice of utilizing probabilistic model checkers is often overlooked due to their propensity to induce state explosion in complex models. To address this, we propose specific strategies aimed at minimizing the state space of a soccer match, thereby mitigating the state explosion issue. We assess the effectiveness of the probabilistic model through various metrics and compare its performance against established deep learning and machine learning baselines. To evaluate its real-world applicability, we also simulate betting based on the predictions of the probabilistic model. This paper concludes by addressing the practical challenges involved in implementing such a predictive model. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.",10.1007/978-3-031-69073-0_22,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85206077474&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-031-69073-0_22&partnerID=40&md5=8bc40fe519a94e30194eb0927f9c38fc,SCOPUS,Si,Verificacion de calculos probabilisticos para predicciones de cuotas de futbol,"F1 Score, Accuracy","PMC, PAT",Fútbol,premiere league,masculino,No,"Grid base modelling, ratings de FIFA como weights y reduccion del espacio de estados.",6 temporadas de la premier ,"Posiciones de los jugadores y balon, prbabilidad de cada accion, evaluacion de secuencias en un partido.",privado,,Evaluar el PMC en prediccion de resultados.,Victoria Empate Derrota,Rentabilidad en temporadas más recientes.,Ratings de jugadores FIFA y dtos históricos de la premier,"2015/16, 2016/17, 2017/18, 2018/19, 2019/20, 2020/21",,Modelo transparente en la toma de decisionoes y evaluación en escenarios de apuestas,"no supera modelos de DL en precisión y se limita a analizar la premier league, además de que los datos no son publicos"

Considering ex-post results and ex-Ante information using betting odds allows investigating the development of both dimensions of competitive balance.

The findings will help MLS officials to draw conclusions to support decision-making around expansion activities or necessary regulations based on the ex-Ante and ex-post balance or imbalance. © 2023 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",10.1504/IJSMM.2023.131952,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85166399761&doi=10.1504%2fIJSMM.2023.131952&partnerID=40&md5=b76ed8ff269477b2e9e8a9daf45fa633,SCOPUS,Si,Balance competitivo consideranto las cuotas antes del partido,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No hay forma de acceder al paper ni con la vpn ni con acceso institucional
,"Determination of Essential Performance Indicator for Football for Discriminating Between Winner, Draw, and Loser Matches in Malaysia Super League 2021","The aims of this study were to (1) determine the essential performance indicator and (2) identify the performance indicators that discriminated between winner, draw, and loser team during Malaysia Super League (MSL) Championship. A total of 38 performance indicators were retrieved from InStat statistic report and notational analysis to check the reliability and validity of the analysis. The principal component analysis (PCA) revealed 20 performance indicators as the essential among the winning team. All the essential performance indicators were then used to discriminate between the winner, draw, and loser matches by using discriminant analysis (DA). The DA discovered that nine out of 20 performance indicators significantly differentiate these three categories of match results with the P value less than 0.05, with 81.37% of sensitivity and sensitivity percentage correct. The significant performance indicators are chances, chances successful, chances (percentage of conversion), shots on target, total number of passes, percentage of accurate passes, key passes, the accurate key passes, and ball possession. All the parameter indicates that the winner team executes significantly higher than the draw and lose team. The outcome of this study may offer the coaches, technical officers, and players a better plan to enhance their team performance. Moreover, the finding provides beneficial information on the characteristics of chances of winning the match. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",10.1007/978-981-99-2162-1_15,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85169052366&doi=10.1007%2f978-981-99-2162-1_15&partnerID=40&md5=d3e1410ecabdee614d4f54913da3624e,SCOPUS,Si,Indicadores de rendimiento para calculo de cuotas,"Precision, Sensibilidad","LDA, PCA",Fútbol,MSL,masculino,No,Eliminación de indicadores irrelevantes,102 partidos con 38 indicadores,"Inicialmente 38, de los cuales se redujeron a 20 con PCA y a 8 con LDA",No se sabe,,"Identificar de los 38 indicadores iniciales cuales son aquellos que más determinan cual es el equipo ganador, perdedor o el que va a empatar",Victoria Empate Derrota,9 indicadores que discriminan entre resultados de partidos con una precisión del 81.37%,Datos de la empresa InStat®,2021/22,,Información clave para mejorar el rendimiento de los equipos y tomar decisiones (enfocado para entrenadores),"Falta de acceso a los datos, y falta de validación para otras ligas u otras temporadas"
,Expert performance and crowd wisdom: Evidence from English Premier League predictions,"This paper analyses the forecasting accuracy of experts vis-à-vis laypeople over three seasons of English Premier League matches. We find that former professional football players have superior forecasting ability when compared to laypeople. The results give partial support to the view that a crowd forecast offers the greatest precision. Pundits generate a positive return while both the crowd and laypeople generate losses. As the prediction of multiple score outcomes represents a computationally difficult task, both groups display forecasting biases including a preference toward specific score forecasts.

Sergio,Temporal aspects and physical behavior of U-21 female beach volleyball players: A study performed of the FIVB World Championship,"Introduction: Volleyball is a dynamic sport in which athletes often use jumps and small displacements during rallies. However, temporal aspects and physical behaviors (e.g., jumps per set and specific movements per set) have not yet been investigated by considering the competition phase and role. Objective: This study aimed to compare temporal and physical indicators by considering the competition phase, set result, and role when possible. Methods: The observed matches were from FIVB Beach Volleyball U21 World Championships 2019. A total of 8 matches, 16 sets, and 556 rallies were observed. The observed parameters showed great intra- and inter-reliability for qualitative and quantitative variables [Kappa ≥ 0.85 - Level of Agreement: strong; intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC ≥ 0.90)]. The sets were split into the phase of the competition (group or final), result of the set (winner or loser), and roles (blocker or defender). The temporal variables (i.e., rally, rest time between rallies, total work time, total rest time, duration of the set, duration of the match, TRT: TWR ratio, and the number of rallies) were compared by considering the competition phase; physical variables (jumps per set, jumps per set in the attack, and specifics movements) were compared by considering the competition phase, set result, and roles. In addition, rallies are classified as short (≤3 s), medium (4-7 s), and long (≥8 s), and the association of the types of rallies with the competition phase was confirmed. Results: Medium rallies are more frequent than other types (~58%). Blockers jump more times per set (p = 0.003) and have more digs with movement (p < 0.001). Conclusions: The competition phase seems to slightly increase the temporal and physical indicators. Moreover, blockers are more physically required. © JPES.",10.7752/jpes.2021.02108,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85104157534&doi=10.7752%2fjpes.2021.02108&partnerID=40&md5=f3ada7acfc6d44904f2ad67e6d513f60,SCOPUS,No,"Es un estudio sobre aspectos físicos en el voleibol femenino dados unos partidos, analizando el tiempo entre rallies y el número de saltos que dan los bloqueadores",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sergio,Champion Position Analysis in Short Track Speed Skating Competitions From 2007 to 2019,"Purpose: Short track speed skating is a racing sport with racing tactics are equally crucial to speed and technical skating skills. Therefore, to investigate the relationship between starting and finishing positions for elite skaters and subsequently, explore pacing patterns for champions are necessary. Methods: To investigate a pattern of effective tactical positioning strategy, Kendall’s tau-b correlations between starting and finishing position were calculated, with 500 m races having the most positive correlation (0.347, P < 0.05). Results: Furthermore, starting position distributions of winners in each round, as well as the fluctuations in champion starting positions across rounds were analyzed. Our findings showed that skaters on the first track were inclined to win the rounds in 500, 1,000, and 1,500 m (28, 28, and 22%, respectively), and the differences between starting and finishing positions for champions were minimized in semi-finals. Meanwhile, the pacing patterns were gaining more fluctuations by the increase of race distances for champions, as the average standard deviation of lap rankings equaled 0.90, 1.15, and 2.21 for 500, 1,000, and 1,500 m races, respectively. Conclusion: In conclusion, elite skaters should adopt flexible tactics at the lowest cost of energy consumption. The overall variability of lap ranking in long-distance races were distinctly higher than it in short distance.

Sergio,Modern and post-modern portfolio theory as applied to moneyline betting,"Modern and post-modern portfolio theory were devised by Harry Markowitz (among others) for purposes of allocating some monetary resources among a number of financial assets so as to strike a suitable balance between risk and expected return. The problem it addresses bears a considerable resemblance to one encountered in making ""moneyline""bets on the outcomes of contests in sports like American football. In distributing some allotted funds among a number of such bets, it may be desired to account for the risk. By introducing suitable modifications, the procedures employed in modern and post-modern portfolio theory for the allocation of resources among financial assets can be adapted for use in the distribution of funds among multiple bets. As in the case of financial assets, the most appropriate measures of risk are ones like the semi-deviation or semi-variance that penalize only negative or below-target returns. The various procedures are illustrated and compared by applying them retrospectively to moneyline bets on the outcomes of the college football ""bowl""games from the 2020 season.  © 2023 the author(s), published by De Gruyter, Berlin/Boston.",10.1515/jqas-2021-0107,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85148703930&doi=10.1515%2fjqas-2021-0107&partnerID=40&md5=5f2042e95360ec5bb7368fb7eaeff9a7,SCOPUS,Podría Ser,"Habla sobre posibles usos del dinero en apuestas, teniendo en cuenta el riesgo que estas podrían conllevar, para llegar a un equilibrio entre riesgo y rendimiento",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sergio,Observational analysis of the variability of actions in judo: The key for success?; [Análise observacional da variabilidade das ações no judô: a chave para o sucesso?]; [Análisis observacional de la variabilidad de acciones en judo: ¿la clave del éxito?],"The main objective of the present study was to determine whether variation in gripping action, actions before attacking, throwing techniques, direction of attack, transition from standing to groundwork combat, and groundwork techniques varied between male and female judo athletes and between gold, silver and bronze medalists in judo World Championships for cadet, junior and senior athletes. Therefore, 296 athletes who won medals in these competitions between 2018 and 2019, who executed a total of 1202 scoring actions in standing position and 300 scoring actions in the groundwork combat were analyzed. Higher variation was observed for gold medal winners for grip actions before attack compared to bronze medalists, whereas transition variation was greater for gold medal winners compared to the other medalists. However, no differences were found between age groups, except when interacting with sex, as a lower technique variation was observed in female cadets compared to all other male age groups. Additionally, less variation was observed in females compared to males for grip, actions before attacking, number of techniques and direction of attacks. Therefore, variation in some elements can properly discriminate the podium position, females present less variation than males, but no relevant differences were found between age groups. © 2020 Universidad de León.",10.18002/rama.v15i2.6341,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85106223170&doi=10.18002%2frama.v15i2.6341&partnerID=40&md5=0be50334e9c907d84e3d67c45a2ec56d,SCOPUS,No,Análisis de diferentes llaves y acciones que se realizan en judo ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sergio,Moderating Effects of Herding Bias on the Relationship Between Parental Monitoring and Problem Gambling of Youths,"One critical issue in problem gambling is its variation as a function of psychosocial factors. We used empirical data from Nigerian youth Soccer gamblers (N = 238) to explore gambling herding bias as a moderator of the relationship between parental monitoring and problem gambling. Specifically, examine how changes in parental monitoring influence changes in problem gambling, and how this influence is a function of levels of herding bias. Hayes PROCESS macro analysis results revealed that increase in parental monitoring was associated with decrease in problem gambling, whereas increase in herding bias was associated with increase in problem gambling. Herding bias positively moderated the relationship between parental monitoring and problem gambling such that, for respondents who had high and moderate herding bias scores, the relationship between parental monitoring and problem gambling was positive and strong, whereas, for repondents with low herding bias scores, the relationship between parental monitoring and problem gambling was negative. The present study reaffirms the negative and positive influences of parental monitoring and herding bias, respectively, on problem gambling among youths. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",10.1007/s10899-021-10061-y,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85125212560&doi=10.1007%2fs10899-021-10061-y&partnerID=40&md5=7c193d4bf0d7568d29355232a92e3148,SCOPUS,No,Relaciona la ludopatía con las restricciones parentales que poseen los niños nigerianos ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sergio,Ball trajectories and probability of scoring a goal in elite male goalball throws,"Goalball court can be divided into six sectors, each measuring 1.5m in width. The sectors are used for analysing the game. To shed light on spatial factors that may influence offensive and defensive success in goalball, we analysed the throwing frequency and attack efficacy with different ball trajectories in elite male goalball attacks. We determined the origin and target sectors (sector 1 on the farright goalpost of the court and sector 6 to the left goalpost to goalpost) of 7949 throws from 49 matches played at Paralympic Games and World Championships. The reliability ranged from .82 to 1.00 using the Kappa index. Our findings showed that attackers frequently used the side sectors as the origin and threw the majority of balls at either the target sectors in front of them or the direct neighbour sectors, justifying a team’s defensive movement as a block towards the opponent’s attack origin. Throw trajectory efficacy originating from sector 2 (the second far-right of the goalpost) was not equally distributed among the different target sectors. In particular, balls directed to sector 3 presented an overall higher likelihood of success (8.4%). Additionally, ball trajectory efficacy from sector 1 to 3 was statistically different between winners vs. losers (5.4% vs. 0.5%, p = .02) and best vs. worst teams 12.4% vs. 2.2%, p = .02). This knowledge has the potential to help goalball coaches to structure specific offensive and defensive training programs. © 2021 by the authors.

Sergio,Estimating the England Premier League Ranking with Artificial Neural Network,"The aim of this study is to estimate the teams’ league rankings at the end of the season by using different parameters peculiar to soccer with artificial neural networks (ANNs). In this study, the values belonging to stealing the ball, number of passes (pass on target, forward pass, and pass before goal scoring), number of possessions during the match, attack time resulting in the goal scoring and number of shots in 1140 competitions played in 2015/2016, 2016/2017, and 2017/2018 England Premier League seasons have been evaluated. Season ranking in the 2017/2018 season has been estimated by analyzing the data in the first two seasons (2015/2016, 2016/2017). All data have been separated randomly for training and test. League ranking has been modeled numerically as 0 and 1. Because the generated value is between 0 and 1, the league ranking has been obtained by multiplying this value by 100 for a trained network. Thanks to the ANN model developed by training and testing according to the findings, the training, validation, test, and all regression values of the English Premier League have been obtained as 0.99779, 0.98123, 0.96981, and 0.98769, respectively. With respect to this result, it has been seen that number of shot, stealing the ball, attack time, and number of possessions parameters are determinant in team ranking at the end of the season along with the other parameters in the England Premier League. We think that analyzing matches with the ANN model provides fast and objective results for team managers, trainers, athletes, and betting shops. © 2021 Taylor & Francis.",10.1080/08839514.2021.1901030,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85102901033&doi=10.1080%2f08839514.2021.1901030&partnerID=40&md5=75d9a1bb95f9495945c47dd1ad95a711,SCOPUS,No,Uso de ANNs para predecir los rankings de los equipos de la Premier League al final de la temporada,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sergio,Fantasy Football (Soccer) Playing and Internet Addiction Among Online Fantasy Football Participants: A Descriptive Survey Study,"The aim of the present study was to ascertain the levels of possible internet addiction within fantasy football (FF) (soccer) participants and the characteristics of the participants within this group. An online survey of questions regarding characteristics of regular FF participants and consumption of FF-related content was posted on FF internet forums (Reddit and Boards.ie). Self-selecting participants (N = 684) completed the survey containing questions on FF (time spent during weekdays/weekend on FF, gambling on FF, devices used to access FF), internet use (time spent on internet on weekdays/weekends) and an internet addiction screening questionnaire (Chen Internet Addiction Scale). Subgroup analysis was performed on each variable by nationality (Irish, UK and worldwide). Of the 684 participants, 17.5% (diagnostic) and 24.9% (screening) participants met criteria for internet addiction, above the expected level in the general population. The most frequent time spent on FF during weekdays was 30–60 min per day (32.2%) and 1–2 h per day on weekends (29.1%). Over half of participants (50.6%) gambled on FF with the majority (61.3%) gambling once per year and 74.3% of participants gambling less than €50 per year on FF. Avid FF participants demonstrated an increased likelihood of internet addiction compared prevalence rates of previous epidemiological studies among different cohorts. This may be due to FF itself and the increased consumption of FF-related content. Further large-scale nationally representative studies are required to compare regular and casual participants of FF in relation to possible internet addiction. © 2020, The Author(s).",10.1007/s11469-020-00436-4,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85097006025&doi=10.1007%2fs11469-020-00436-4&partnerID=40&md5=7b2a81dafa85feff4b394fc6c78c5ce1,SCOPUS,No,Adicción a internet debido al Fútbol Fantasy (Normal),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To evaluate the question whether the models developed by us could be used easily to make money via sports betting, we evaluate three cases: NCAAB post-season, NBA season, and NFL season, and find that it is possible yet not without its pitfalls. In particular, we illustrate that high accuracy does not automatically equal high pay-out, by looking at the type of match-ups that are predicted correctly by different models.

,Forecasting football results and exploiting betting markets: The case of “both teams to score”,"The continuous growth of available football data presents unprecedented research opportunities for a better understanding of football dynamics. While many research works focus on predicting which team will win a match, other interesting questions, such as whether both teams will score in a game, are still unexplored and have gained momentum with the rise of betting markets. With this in mind, we investigate the following research questions in this paper: “How difficult is the ‘both teams to score’ (BTTS) prediction problem?”, “Are machine learning classifiers capable of predicting BTTS better than bookmakers?”, and “Are machine learning classifiers useful for devising profitable betting strategies in the BTTS market?”. We collected historical football data, extracted groups of features to represent the teams’ strengths, and fed these to state-of-the-art classification models. We performed a comprehensive set of experiments and showed that, although hard to predict, in some scenarios it is possible to outperform bookmakers, which are robust baselines per se. More importantly, in some cases it is possible to beat the market and devise profitable strategies based on machine learning algorithms. The results are encouraging and, besides shedding light on the problem, may provide novel insights for all kinds of football stakeholders. © 2021 International Institute of Forecasters",10.1016/j.ijforecast.2021.06.008,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85112202603&doi=10.1016%2fj.ijforecast.2021.06.008&partnerID=40&md5=c508046f9cef927684789c83ee56f61d,SCOPUS,Si,Se centra en si un modelo de clasificación state-of-the-art es capaz de predecir si dos equipos anotarán en el partido ,"Precision, Brier Score, Profitability","Logistic Regression, Clasificadores de Poisson, Classification, XGB Classifier, Gaussian Naïve Methods",Fútbol,"Liga Brasileña, premiere league, Ligue 1(francia), Bundesliga, Serie A, Liga Holandesa, liga española, Liga Portuguesa",masculino,No,"Feature engineering, normalización de caracteristicas, y conversión de cuotas de apuestas en probabilidades mediante el método shin",~20k partidos y ~700k cuotas ,"Promedio de victorias, empates y derrotas, goles a favor, goles en contra; probabilidades de si un equipo marca en partidos consecutivos",público,https://www.betexplorer.com/,Probabilidad de predecir si ambos equipos anotarán en un partido de fútbol,BTTS,los modelos no fueron consistentemente rentables al apostar en todos los partidos,betexplorer,"2013/14, 2014/15, 2015/16, 2016/17, 2017/18, 2018/19, 2019/20",,El artículo proporciona un enfoque novedoso para predecir si ambos equipos anotarán en un partido de fútbol,"Limitaciones en la rentabilidad, dependencia del mercado de apuestas, y falta generalización"
Sergio,"NFL betting market efficiency, divisional rivals, and profitable strategies","Purpose: This paper aims to examine market inefficiencies in the National Football League (NFL) betting market from the 2003 season to the 2016 season. Design/methodology/approach: The author examines the impact that division rivals and previously known determinants of inefficiencies have on the current NFL gambling market. Findings: The results show that games against division rivals have a lower chance of the home team covering the spread and the chance the game will result in an over. This result demonstrates that the sportsbooks underestimate the familiarity that teams have with each other’s players, coaches and tendencies from playing each other twice per year. Moreover, using this result in conjunction with previous known inefficiencies, the author puts forth a model to test out of sample predictions. The results from these tests show profitable strategies in the point spread and totals market with a win rate of nearly 57 per cent.

Sergio,What pacing is used by the best swimmers in the 200m freestyle?,"We examine the pacing strategies of elite swimmers of the 200m freestyle from six long courses World Championships and three editions of the Olympic Games. The entries, partials, and total race times of the finalist swimmers were analysed. The results showed that the 1st lap is the one with the most significant difference, both for males (0.0008) and females (<0.0001), justified by the push-off against a solid (block). In addition, athletes perform their strategies assuming a negative correlation in the 1st half of the race and a positive correlation in the 2nd half. Also, the winner's time difference percentage was below compared with the median of total race time, where the Transition α (difference between 1st to 2nd and 3rd places, and the difference of 3rd place to other athletes) is faster in the 2nd half of the race by +3.23% for men and +2.50% for women. It is concluded that the 1st lap presents better reciprocity to the final time. The winners are faster than the median in the 2nd half of the race.

Utilizing Social Media Analytics (SMA), we track the international discourse of the CSL and its associated actors throughout the social media landscape. Our findings reveal that the CSL is framed primarily by professional actors offering match information and results as well as betting and streaming services. Yet, fan engagement vis-à-vis CSL clubs, players and matches is limited in its extent. Thus, our results indicate that the international fan base of the CSL remains largely underdeveloped. Altogether, we contribute to extant literature in sports management by illustrating how an emerging methodological approach can be utilised, assessing a critical aspect of China’s ambitions with regards to football, and the associated challenges that emerging leagues face in terms of attracting international fans despite considerable investment in recent years. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",10.1080/17430437.2021.1916245,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85107443103&doi=10.1080%2f17430437.2021.1916245&partnerID=40&md5=c4e2d5288d5ea0f2bf0c1ff0eceb741b,SCOPUS,No,Cómo se habla en rrss sobre la super liga china (control gubernamental¿?) ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sergio,Finding a niche in digital plenitude: sport media strategies of smaller European football leagues,"Research question: Digital disruption is heavily impacting incumbent sports media business models. While major sports seem to cope with digital disruption, the challenges appear much bigger for minor sports. Therefore, the contribution focuses on the efforts of smaller European football leagues to adapt their business models. Two research questions follow: RQ1: What are the most important challenges to the BMs of smaller football leagues? RQ2: Which approaches to adapt BMs are explored by the smaller leagues examined? Research methods: A comparative case study was conducted. The sample consisted of eight European smaller football leagues, which are characterized by substantial diversity in terms of population size, wealth and sporting quality. The empirical material consists of document analyses and expert interviews with league managers exploring broadcasting rights, revenues, the competition within the media environment and future broadcasting strategies. Results and findings: Aggressive global competition and changing media consumption patterns and behaviors challenges the incumbent business models. The leagues are actively exploring new business models, although these efforts are rather conservative. Most successful is the collective marketing of overseas rights and the selling of betting rights. The leagues struggle to capture value from datafication and new media outlets. Implications: The leagues face a complex challenge to increase local interest to combat interest from globally dominant leagues. They have to develop a ‘digital mindset’ and to balance value creation and capture. The hybrid strategy using traditional distribution channels as ‘backbone’ while exploring new BMs should occur. They should consider intensifying collective marketing efforts. © 2023 European Association for Sport Management.",10.1080/16184742.2023.2218868,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85161397552&doi=10.1080%2f16184742.2023.2218868&partnerID=40&md5=a9ecb9e2795bce499ad748737026835a,SCOPUS,No,No da datos interesantes para poder centrarnos tal vez en ligas de fútbol menores donde las casas de apuestas tienen menor control de las cuotas,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Contest incentives, team effort, and betting market outcomes in European football","Research Question: The study asks whether bookmakers alter the closing betting odds on European football matches due to potential variation in team incentives to exert effort to win games based on position in the standings. Effort is a multidimensional concept and teams have many ways to alter effort supplied in a match. For example, the players included or left out of the starting 11, the tactics used in a specific match, substitutions made during a match, and other factors under team control, can be interpreted as changes in effort supplied. Research Methods: OLS models explaining observed variation in betting odds are estimated for roughly 25,000 regular season football games in 8 top European domestic leagues from 2000–2001 through 2018–2019. Results: Regression results indicate bookmakers alter betting odds on matches involving clubs in the middle of the domestic league standings that have no chance of qualifying for the Champions/Europa Leagues or being relegated. In other words, bookmakers and bettors believe these teams will not put forth maximum effort to compete in and win these matches. We find similar results for teams already assured of relegation and teams that already clinched the league championship. Implications: Overall, the research contributes to literature analyzing the impact of incentives in sporting contests. As the world of professional sport and sports gambling become increasingly interconnected and integrated, the results of the study present opportunities not only for collaboration between the parties but also an increased understanding on the role league design has on individual match outcomes. © 2021 European Association for Sport Management.",10.1080/16184742.2021.1898432,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85103013892&doi=10.1080%2f16184742.2021.1898432&partnerID=40&md5=817fe06af6b9d15185f3c2af6a8cc8ae,SCOPUS,Si,Podría ser de utilidad para tener en cuenta en función de la posición del equipo en la tabla antes del partido y de cuantas jornadas queden para acabar la liga,r2,Linear Regression - OLS (Ordinary Least Squares),Fútbol,"Liga Belga, liga española, premiere league, Bundesliga, Ligue 1(francia), liga turca, Serie A, Liga Portuguesa",masculino,No,"Método de Kuypers para el cálculo de probabilidades implícitas, y variables binarias para indicar si un equipo se había asegurado el campeonato, puestos de competiciones europeas o si había descendido",~25k partidos,Variables de incentivos y variables de control,público,,"Investigar si las casas de apuestas ajustan las cuotas de los partidos de fútbol europeo en función de los incentivos de los equipos para esforzarse, basándose en su posición en la tabla de la liga.",Victoria Empate Derrota,"Las probabilidades de victoria disminuyen para los equipos que ya han asegurado el campeonato, un puesto en competiciones europeas, o que ya están descendidos matemáticamente, lo que sugiere que estos equipos tienen menos incentivos para esforzarse al máximo.",football-data.co.uk,"2000/01, 2001/02, 2003/04, 2002/03, 2004/05, 2005/06, 2006/07, 2007/08, 2009/10, 2010/11, 2008/09, 2011/12, 2012/13, 2013/14, 2014/15, 2015/16, 2018/19, 2017/18, 2016/17",,Los mercados de apuestas son eficientes en la incorporación de información sobre el esfuerzo de los equipos,"Limitaciones en la medición del esfuerzo, falta de datos detallados, y falta de generalización"
,Comparing State-of-the-Art Neural Network Ensemble Methods in Soccer Predictions,"For many reasons, including sports being one of the main forms of entertainment in the world, online gambling is growing. And in growing markets, opportunities to explore it arise. In this paper, neural network ensemble approaches, such as bagging, random subspace sampling, negative correlation learning and the simple averaging of predictions, are compared. For each one of these methods, several combinations of input parameters are evaluated. We used only the expected goals metric as predictors since it is able to have good predictive power while keeping the computational demands low. These models are compared in the soccer (also known as association football) betting context where we have access to metrics, such as rentability, to analyze the results in multiple perspectives. The results show that the optimal solution is goal-dependent, with the ensemble methods being able to increase the accuracy up to +3 % over the best single model. The biggest improvement over the single model was obtained by averaging dropout networks. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",10.1007/978-3-030-59491-6_13,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85092106300&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-030-59491-6_13&partnerID=40&md5=feffe72531e25e2bb518c69194305a4e,SCOPUS,Si,Uso de ANNs de state-of-the-art para predicciones con accuracy +3% que el mejor modelo simple,Precision,Red Neuronal,Fútbol,,masculino,No,Selección y transformación de características,Múltiples temporadas de datos,"Estadísticas de equipo, rendimientos individuales, datos de partidos",No se sabe,,Comparar diferentes métodos de ensamble en redes neuronales para la predicción de resultados de partidos de fútbol.,Victoria Empate Derrota,"Los métodos de ensamble mejoran la precisión en comparación con modelos individuales, destacándose stacking como la mejor técnica.",,,,Demuestra que los métodos de ensamble pueden mejorar la precisión en predicciones de fútbol,No se detallan suficientemente los datos utilizados ni se comparan con modelos fuera del ámbito de redes neuronales
,The National Football League and efficient market hypothesis: An analysis of trends in Thursday night football and post-bye week games,"This study investigates the efficiency of National Football League betting markets from 2002 to 2015 utilizing three rest patterns (Thursday Night Football, post-bye week, and regularly scheduled games). The logistic model indicates that inefficiencies due to the rest patterns occurred in Thursday Night Football and post-bye week games, with bettors expecting high rates of return. The forecast errors also provide evidence that point spreads did not correctly forecast future outcomes. Nevertheless, this deviation from efficiency was not sufficient to make positive returns from Thursday Night Football when teams of record were tested separately. A bias from post-bye week games remained profitable across the studied years, suggesting previously confirmed biases were not temporary. Although further analyses with a larger sample size are needed to confirm whether Thursday Night Football creates a bias consistently, this study suggests that the betting market misses important information about rest intervals and team performance. © 2020, West Virginia University",10.32731/IJSF/152.052020.02,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85110080816&doi=10.32731%2fIJSF%2f152.052020.02&partnerID=40&md5=c09e2d3b17d5db510a24912e20222ad0,SCOPUS,Si,Ineficiencia del mercado de apuestas para rendimiento de equipos tras parones de descanso,Precision,Logistic Regression,Fútbol Americano,NFL,masculino,No,Filtrado de datos eliminando empates en el point spread,~3k partidos ,"Condición de local, favoritismo, closing lines, diferencias en días de descanso, juegos tras semanas de descanso",No se sabe,,Analizar si los patrones de descanso en la NFL generan oportunidades de arbitraje en apuestas,Bet result,"Se encontraron ineficiencias en el mercado de apuestas, particularmente en juegos tras una semana de descanso (bye week), donde los equipos favoritos en condición de visitante superaron consistentemente las expectativas del mercado con un retorno promedio del 29.05%.",sportsinsights.com y covers.com,"2002/03, 2003/04, 2005/06, 2004/05, 2006/07, 2007/08, 2008/09, 2009/10, 2010/11, 2011/12, 2012/13, 2013/14, 2014/15",,"El mercado de apuestas no ajusta correctamente los efectos del descanso en el rendimiento del equipo, lo que puede ser aprovechado para mejorar estrategias de apuestas.",Limitaciones en el tamaño de la muestra para algunos análisis
Sergio,Importance of Maintaining Net Position in Men’s and Women’s Professional Padel,"The objective of this research was to analyze the importance of maintaining the net position in men’s and women’s professional padel. The data sample was drawn from 2,756 padel rallies (n = 1,434 men’s and n = 1,322 women’s) in matches played during the 2021 season of the World Padel Tour circuit. The results showed that there was no net exchange in 50.7% of the women’s rallies, while in 65.9% of men’s rallies, the servers kept the net. Due to their physical advantages, men servers had more opportunities to finish the rally at the net than women servers, giving them more opportunities to win the rally. However, when either men or women receivers finished the rally at the net, they had more opportunities to win the rally. In addition, both men and women tended to end the rallies with a winner when they were in the net zone and with an error when they were at the back of the court. These findings suggest that wins in padel are closely related to time spent at the net. © The Author(s) 2023.",10.1177/00315125231194026,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85170567768&doi=10.1177%2f00315125231194026&partnerID=40&md5=ac6e6db6928a5357d2c9b7806158e6bc,SCOPUS,No,"Que si subes y mantienes la red en el pádel es más probable que ganes el punto (lógico), además habla de una diferencia física grande entre hombres y mujeres (rarete)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sergio,"The growth of sports betting in Malawi: corporate strategies, public space and public health","Objectives: Gambling is increasingly positioned as a public health issue, with links to a wide range of harms for individuals, communities and societies. Malawi has experienced a rapid rise in the availability of high street and online sports betting services, situated in a context of extreme inequality and poverty. We aim to document the strategies through which a leading sports betting firm have established a market worth MK2.1bn, to inform future initiatives to mitigate gambling-related harm. Study design: A case study of strategies deployed by a leading firm to grow a sports betting market in Malawi. Methods: We undertook a qualitative media analysis of articles from six major Malawian news outlets and combined this with photographic evidence relating to company advertising and presence in Malawian public space. Data were analysed thematically and triangulated to generate a typology of corporate strategies. Results: We collected 39 articles and 15 photographs. After we screened the articles, we analysed 27 and identified seven corporate strategies: adopt a mobile network franchise model; use media coverage; purchase high-visibility advertising; sponsor locally; build association with (European) football; appeal to aspects of hegemonic masculinity; construct narratives of individual and collective benefit. Conclusion: Malawi has been exposed to a sophisticated set of corporate strategies aimed at growing a sports betting market. These strategies have been successful, and it is likely that a range of foreseeable gambling-related harms are affecting Malawi.

Sergio,Predicting seasonal performance in professional sport: A 30-year analysis of sports illustrated predictions,"In 2017, Sports Illustrated (SI) made headlines when their remarkable prediction from 2014 that the Houston Astros (a team in one of the lowest Major League Baseball divisional rankings) would win the World Series, came true. The less-publicised story was that in 2017, SI predicted the Los Angeles Dodgers to win the Major League Baseball (MLB) title. Assessing the forecasting accuracy of experts is critical as it explores the difficulty and limitations of forecasts and can help illuminate how predictions may shape sociocultural notions of sport in society. To thoroughly investigate SI’s forecasting record, predictions were collected from the four major North American sporting leagues (the National Football League, National Basketball Association, Major League Baseball, and National Hockey League) over the last 30 years (1988–2018). Kruskal–Wallis H Tests and Mann–Whitney U Tests were used to evaluate the absolute and relative accuracy of predictions. Results indicated that SI had the greatest predictive accuracy in the National Basketball Association and was significantly more likely to predict divisional winners compared to conference and league champions. Future work in this area may seek to examine multiple media outlets to gain a more comprehensive perspective on forecasting accuracy in sport. © 2021 by the authors.

When the reward increases beyond a certain threshold, a profitable strategy can be devised. Here, we present a machine-learning algorithm scheme to play WINNER 16. Our proposed algorithm is marginally profitable on average in a range of hyperparameters, indicating inefficiencies in this game. To make a better prize-pricing mechanism we suggest a generalization of the single-bet approach. We studied the expected profit and risk of WINNER 16 after applying our suggestion.

,Dimensionality reduction for real sports data from the German Bundesliga and English Premier League,"Recently, sports performance forecasting has become a topic of great interest among both researchers and practitioners. The goal of such forecasts is not only to better understand the meanderings and strategies of sports competitions, but also to be able to use these forecasts for commercial purposes, such as sports betting. These forecasts are based on the analysis of historical data and characteristics that affect the outcome of the games. One important aspect of this process is the selection of features that are used to create predictive models. The selection of appropriate features has a significant impact on the quality of the predictions, as well as on the comprehensibility and simplicity of the model. In this article, we present a dimensionality reduction approach to create a reduced set of features for effective classification of sports performance. The article presents the results of sports performance prediction experiments using the English Premier League and German Bundesliga as examples. The aim of the study was to create a reduced set of features that would allow equally effective classification using a heterogeneous set of classifiers compared to a full list of features. Experimental results indicate that it is possible to reduce the feature list without significant loss of classification quality. In the case of the German Bundesliga, the best results were obtained with the'Sequential-back' approach, which consists of features:'PositionHT', 'MatchesHT', 'WinsHT', 'GoalDifferenceHT', 'WinsVT', 'PointsVT' i'Difference'. For the English Premier League, the'Importance' approach, which includes features, performed best:'PositionHT', 'WinsHT', 'DrawsHT', 'LossesHT', 'PositionVT', 'DrawsVT' i'LossesHT'. In both cases, the reduced set of features allowed for comparable results with the full set of features. The results have potential applications in predicting the performance of less popular football leagues, where access to statistics is limited. The shortened list of features can also reduce the time needed for model development and prediction. © 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

,Sports Analytics in Practice with R,"In the last twenty years, sports organizations have become a data-driven business. Before this, most decisions in sports were qualitatively driven by subject-matter experts. In the years since numerous teams found success with “Money Ball” analytical perspectives, the industry has sought to advance its analytical acumen to improve on-and off-field outcomes. The increasing demand for data to inform decisions for coaches, scouts, and players before and during sporting events has led to intriguing efforts to build upon this quantitative approach. As this methodology for assessing performance has matured and grown in importance, so too has the open-source R software emerged as one of the leading analytical software packages. In fact, R is a top 10 programming language that is useful in academia and industry for statistics, machine learning, and rapid prototyping. Sports Analytics in Practice with R neatly marries these two advances to teach basic analytics for sports-related use—from cricket to baseball, from basketball to tennis, from soccer to sports gambling, and more.

Sergio,Performance indicators in women’s volleyball Olympics and World Championships (2014–2021),"The aim of this study was to explore the match and technical indicators between winning and losing women's teams in the Olympics and World Championships (2016–2021) depending on the final score of the matches and to compare the winners’ technical indicators in 3-set matches to those of men in the respective competitions. A total of 281 volleyball matches were analyzed from the Women's Olympics (2016 and 2021) and World Championships (2014 and 2018). Discriminant function analysis determined which skill(s) contributed significantly to winning matches in every type of score. This study showed that the teams that won 3-0 and 3-1 matches had better performance in all scoring skills (serve, attack, block, and opponent errors) compared to their opponents, while the opponents’ errors did not affect the result. In 5-set matches, block points were the main predictor of a team's success. In conclusion, the results of the women's teams at the highest level of volleyball matches, show that different performance indicators determine the match outcome. The attack is not the only skill that increases the probability of winning a match, since block and serve to contribute equally significantly. Furthermore, in 5-set matches, blocking is the technical skill that differentiates the winning from the losing teams. Finally, in 3-set matches, it seems that the performance indicators differ between women and men in attack efficiency, block, and opponent error points. © The Author(s) 2022.",10.1177/17479541221106378,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85132544906&doi=10.1177%2f17479541221106378&partnerID=40&md5=727fa09dfd2e00bb1d863148455f706f,SCOPUS,Podría Ser,"No se si nos queremos centrar en el voleibol, pero este estudio hace un análisis sobre diferentes indicadores en partidos, de forma que dada su tendencia puede determinar si gana el partido, aunque no se muy bien si la predicción la hace previa al resultado o la idea es que dados unos indicadores de un partido determinar si se ha ganado o perdido.

Sergio,Does sports betting affect investment behaviour? Evidence from Ghanaian sports betting participants,"The study sought to assess the impact of sports betting on the investment behaviour of Ghanaians, focusing on sports betting centers within the Accra Metropolis, Ghana. The objectives of this observational study were to determine how individuals perceive the risk of sports lotteries as opposed to investment, to determine if sports lottery was viewed as an alternative to investments and savings, and to understand how participation in sports lotteries affects individuals’ ability to save and invest. In adopting a survey approach, 99 sports betting participants across selected betting centers were examined using questionnaires and the data subsequently analyzed through cross-tabulations. The study found that sports betting behaviour had a complementary rather than a substitutionary effect on investment behaviour. The participants were both risk-aware and risk-averse, but engaged nevertheless in betting for a chance of winning a high payoff. Thus, the findings demonstrated that sports betting participants viewed betting as a means to an end, a chance to improve their financial circumstances, rather than as a substitute for investing, and exhibited understanding of a clear distinction, with regards to behaviour, towards investing and sports betting. In return for a substantive payoff, the respondents were willing to stop sports betting, thereby indicating that the financial payoffs were the main motivation for sports betting. The findings also provided evidence that individual sports betting behaviour can be moderated by influencing one’s financial circumstances. © 2019, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health.

Sergio,Predicting Football Match Results Using a Poisson Regression Model,"Currently, several techniques based on probabilities and statistics, along with the rapid advancements in computational power, have deepened our understanding of a football match result, giving us the capability to estimate future matches’ results based on past performances. The ability to estimate the number of goals scored by each team in a football match has revolutionized the perspective of a match result for both betting market professionals and fans alike. The Poisson distribution has been widely used in a number of studies to model the number of goals a team is likely to score in a football match. Therefore, the match result can be estimated using a double Poisson regression model—one for each participating team. In this study, we propose an algorithm, which, by using Poisson distributions along with football teams’ historical performance, is able to predict future football matches’ results. This algorithm has been developed based on the Premier League’s—England’s top-flight football championship—results from the 2022–2023 season. © 2024 by the authors.",10.3390/app14167230,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85202451522&doi=10.3390%2fapp14167230&partnerID=40&md5=f664b3d78e1938227ecf6194297d065a,SCOPUS,Podría Ser,Puede estar interesante,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sergio,Competition seriousness and competition level modulate testosterone and cortisol responses in soccer players,"This study aimed to analyze the modulating effect of competition seriousness and competition level in the testosterone and cortisol responses in professional soccer player. Ninety five (95) soccer players were included in this study (professional, n = 39; semiprofessional, n = 27; amateur, n = 29) before and after training, friendly game and official games. Repeated measures ANOVA showed higher testosterone levels (F(1,89) = 134, p < 0.0001, η2p = 0.75) in professional soccer players, when compared with semiprofessional (p < 0.0001) or amateur athletes (p < 0.0001). After winning a competition game an increase in testosterone levels was observed in professionals (t = −3.456, p < 0.001), semiprofessionals (t = −4.400, p < 0.0001), and amateurs (t = −2.835, p < 0.009). In contrast, this momentary hormonal fluctuation was not observed after winning a friendly game or during a regular training day. Additionally, statistical analysis indicated that cortisol levels were lower in professional (t = −3.456, p < 0.001) and semiprofessional athletes (t = −4.400, p < 0.0001) than in amateurs (t = −2.835, p < 0.009). In soccer players a rise in testosterone was only observable when the team was faced with an actual challenge but did not support a different response between categories. Thus, the desire to achieve a goal (and keep the social status) may be one of the key reasons why testosterone levels rise promptly. Conversely, testosterone did not change after friendly games, which suggests these situations are not real goals and the players do not perceive an actual threat (in terms of dominance) more than the preparation for their next competitive game. © 2020 by the authors.

Sergio,Players of male football teams’ resilience: comparative analysis of content parameters,"The purpose of the article is an empirical study and comparison of the content parameters of the resilience of male football teams that won (Group 1; n=66), lost Group 2; n=66), and drew (Group 3; n=44). Research methods: valid psychodiagnostic methods using standard survey forms were used in the study, as well as Spearman correlation analysis (rs) and the Student’s t-test. Results. It has been substantiated that the resilience of male football players is an integrated set of qualities, protective mechanisms, psychophysiological processes, and psycho-emotional states targeted at dealing with adversity, struggling, and overcoming/ not overcoming stress with a new level of functioning. It was found that the Resilience parameters of players who drew (Group 3) and players who won (Group 1) varied significantly RS (t=2.3; р<.05). It is explained that a team that receives a draw from the pre-game setup might develop such an expected model of events, which is followed by the mobilization of internal psycho-emotional efforts to the highest potential degree of player resilience. The resilience factors of Group 1 over Group 2 were revealed to be Cheerfulness (t=2.1; р<.05) and Motivation to Succeed (t=3.2; р<.01). It is established (р<.01; р<.05) and proven that an active life position, optimism, love for life, and emotional stability are powerful motivators for winning football players. Conclusions. The first hypothesis was rejected since the significant differences in resilience between Group 3 and Group 1 were t=2.3; р<.05, indicating that the players who played a draw outweighed the winners in terms of Resilience. The second hypothesis was confirmed since Group 3 respondents consistently outweighed Group 2 respondents in Resilience and Motivation to Succeed (р<.05). It is recommended to include the acquired results into the coaching staff’s work on football players’ tactical and psychological preparation for the game. © JPES.",10.7752/jpes.2022.07199,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85135456721&doi=10.7752%2fjpes.2022.07199&partnerID=40&md5=b215dc07505200bab940df796e438f3c,SCOPUS,No,Estado anímico be like: perder << empatar << ganar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sergio,AN ANALYSIS OF TEMPORAL NUMERICAL SUPERIORITY IN THE PAN-AMERICAN JUNIOR MEN'S WATER POLO MATCHES,"This study compared the frequency, number of goals and attack efficiency in temporal numerical superiority among winning and losing teams and among balanced and unbalanced matches in a junior men's water polo competition. Another analysed relationship was that between a balanced or unbalanced final score and the efficiency at scoring goals in numerical superiority in the winning teams' games. A total of 56 matches from the Pan-American Junior Men's Water Polo championship was analysed. The teams were categorised as losers or winners and the match results were classified as balanced or unbalanced. The chi-squared and Mann-Whitney tests were used for statistical treatment. There is no significant difference in the occurrence of numerical superiority between winners and losers (p = 0.25) despite the winners scoring more goals (p = 0.002) and being more efficient (p < 0.001). There is no significant difference in the occurrence of numerical superiority (p = 0.81) and goals (p = 0.03) in balanced and unbalanced matches. However, there tends to be a higher shot efficiency (p = 0.01) in unbalanced matches. A significant relationship exists (p = 0.04) between the winning teams' efficiency at scoring goals in a situation of numerical superiority and an unbalanced score. © 2022 Universidade Estadual de Maringa.

Sergio,Relationships between the technique index and performance in 60-m hurdle indoor races in elite male heptathletes,"A practical assessment of the hurdle clearance technique was carried out applying the technique index (TINDEX ), namely the difference between performance in a hurdle race and performance in a respective race without hurdles. The aim of the present study was to examine TINDEX of combined events athletes that competed in all World and European Indoor Athletics Championships. The analysis included the heptathletes who won (n = 84) or did not win (n = 192) a medal, the progress of TINDEX per decade (1990s: n = 75; 2000s: n = 97; 2010s: n = 104) and its correlation with performance (total points won) in heptathlon for a total of 276 cases from the heptathlon 60-m sprint and 60-m hurdle races held from 1993 to 2019. Results revealed that medal winners (median [interquartile range] = 0.99 [0.20] s) had significantly (p < 0.001) lower TINDEX compared to non-medal winners (1.10 [0.24] s). No significant (p > 0.05) TINDEX differences were observed among the cases in the examined decades. Finally, a significant negative correlation (τb = –0.27, p < 0.001) was observed for TINDEX and performance in heptathlon. In conclusion, hurdle clearance with the minimum time loss is a precondition for success in indoor combined events. © 2021, University School of Physical Education.

Sergio,Hydroxyapatite/L-Lysine Composite Coating as Glassy Carbon Electrode Modifier for the Analysis and Detection of Nile Blue A,"An amperometric sensor was developed by depositing a film coating of hydroxyapatite (HA)/L-lysine (Lys) composite material on a glassy carbon electrode (GCE). It was applied for the detection of Nile blue A (NBA). Hydroxyapatite was obtained from snail shells and its structural properties before and after its combination with Lys were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area analyses. The coupling of Lys to HA was attributed to favorable interaction between negatively charged-COO− groups of Lys and divalent ions Ca2+ of HA. Electrochemical investigations pointed out the improvement in sensitivity of the GCE/Lys/HA sensor towards the detection of NBA in solution. The dependence of the peak current and potential on the pH, scan rate, and NBA concentration was also investigated. Under optimal conditions, the GCE/Lys/HA sensor showed a good reproducibility, selectivity, and a NBA low detection limit of 5.07 × 10−8 mol L−1. The developed HA/Lys-modified electrode was successfully applied for the detection of NBA in various water samples. © 2022 by the authors.

Sergio,Dealing with small samples in football research,"In football research, ‘small’ trials with low statistical power are common. On the elite level, the inherently low number of participants obviously conflicts with the relevance of even tiny effects. However, general characteristics of football also contribute (e.g. multifactorially influenced and/or complex outcomes). Importantly, small sample sizes are problematic regardless of the study outcome with issues ranging from inconclusive results and low precision to unrepeatable ‘discoveries’ and overestimation of effect sizes. Therefore, meeting the calculated, target sample size is the first priority. If a suboptimal sample size must be accepted, a range of tools can improve insights. To begin with, some general aspects of data collection and analysis become more important and should be optimally implemented (e.g. reliability of measures). Building on this foundation, specific amendments are available on the levels of data collection (e.g. aggregated single-subject designs) and data analysis (e.g. Bayesian methods). The present commentary aims to give an overview of selected, practical tools for dealing with small sample sizes in football research and provide recommendations for their application in scenarios typical for the field. Importantly, versatility and adaptability are mirrored by the need for utmost transparency including a predetermined (ideally preregistered) study plan.

Sergio,Predicting Sports Results with Artificial Intelligence - A Proposal Framework for Soccer Games,"As the sports betting industry and technology have grown on a large scale, predicting the outcome of a sports match using technologies approach is now crucial. In fact, humans have a certain limitation when processing a large set of information. However, Artificial Intelligence techniques can overcome this issue. Furthermore, sports have a great amount of data to consider, thus, it is a great example of AI problem. A review of some research using different Artificial Intelligence techniques to predict a sport outcome is presented in this article. Different types of sports such as football, soccer, javelin throw, basketball, and horse race were analyzed, and showed distinct approaches to predict results. Finally, a framework to develop a system to predict the outcome of a soccer game based on AI is proposed, considering the present research review. © 2019 The Authors.

Sergio,Epidemiology of Competition Injuries in Elite European Judo Athletes: A Prospective Cohort Study,"Objective:To determine the injury incidence rate (IIR) and injury pattern, and to identify risk factors for injury, among elite adult European judo athletes.Design:Prospective cohort study.Setting:The 2015 Under 23 European Judo Championships, Bratislava, Slovakia.Participants:All registered athletes (N = 295).Independent Variables:Sex, weight division, and fight outcome.Main Outcome Measures:Injury incidence rates were calculated per 1000 athlete-exposures (IIRAE) and per 1000 minutes of exposure (IIRME) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Subgroups were compared by calculating the injury incidence rate ratio (RR) with a 95% CI.Results:The overall IIRAE and IIRME were 35.6 (95% CI, 22.8-53.0) and 10.9 (95% CI, 7.0-16.2), respectively. The most frequently injured anatomical region was the head/neck (41%), whereas the most common type of injury was contusion (33%). The risk of injury was almost 4 times greater for defeated athletes compared with winners [RRME 3.80 (95% CI, 1.47-9.82)]. Athletes in middleweight divisions had a greater risk of injury compared with their lightweight [RRME 3.58 (95% CI, 1.24-10.35)] and heavyweight [RRME 2.34 (95% CI, 0.93-5.89)] counterparts. The risk of injury for women was not significantly different from their male counterparts [RRME 1.33 (95% CI, 0.61-2.90)].Conclusions:Weight division (middle) and fight outcome (losing) are significant risk factors for injury. The IIR in elite adult judo competition is lower than that in taekwondo and karate. Future research is encouraged to investigate the actual severity of judo injuries, and to investigate potentially modifiable risk factors to mitigate the risk of injury in judo. © 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Sergio,Analysis of Goal Scoring Pathway for the Winners in UEFA Champions League Competition,"In soccer, goal scoring becomes the main factor in distinguishing between the winning and losing teams. One of the most crucial components of a soccer team's offensive performance is the goal-scoring path since it has been correlated with a higher likelihood of winning games. Therefore, the study aims to investigate the pathway of goal scoring among the winning teams in the previous seven consecutive seasons (2015/2016 – 2021/2022) in the UEFA Champions League competition. A total of 216 goals from the UEFA Champions League competitions in seven prior seasons (2015/2016-2019/2020) were examined. The pathway of goal scoring has been divided into long sequence passing, short sequence passing, and others. All the data have been recorded by using hand notational analysis and analyzed by using one-way ANOVA. A total of 216 goals were scored throughout the competition showing that 108 goals were from long sequence passing, 57 goals were from short sequence passing, and 51 goals came from others. The result indicated that there was a significant difference in the goal scoring sequence toward goal success among the winners, p > 0.00 which showed long sequence passing had the highest amount of goal scoring. As a summary, this demonstrated that the winning teams in 7 consecutive seasons of the UEFA Champions League competition (2015/2016 – 2021/2022) used long sequence passing frequently as their main attacking style to score a goal, which directly led them to win the championship. Therefore, the findings of this study may also be useful to coaches for educational reform in the soccer sports since they may allow them to make predictions about the best team tactics and goal-scoring strategies. It is suggested that future research examine teams of varied rankings to determine how goals are scored differently on each side. © 2023 by authors, all rights reserved.",10.13189/saj.2023.110601,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85172896834&doi=10.13189%2fsaj.2023.110601&partnerID=40&md5=04b5bce1f23827b087cf1195a9994d2d,SCOPUS,No,No es de interés para el proyecto ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: A content analysis of the 2017 Australian Football League (AFL) Grand Final television broadcast identified episodes of unhealthy food and sugary drink, alcohol and gambling marketing (and pro-health marketing as a comparison). Results: There were 559 unhealthy marketing episodes (47 minutes 17 seconds). Most (81%) were for unhealthy food and sugary drink products, while alcohol (9%) and gambling (10%) were less frequent. The total duration of unhealthy marketing was delivered primarily via fixed advertising (55%), dynamic advertising (32%) and branded objects (11%). For unhealthy food and sugary drinks, at least one episode was visible 25% of the time. For each of alcohol and gambling, at least one episode was visible 4% of the time. Unhealthy food and sugary drink marketing peaked in Quarter 2. Pro-health marketing was limited, with 26 episodes (2 minutes 59 seconds). Conclusions: The 2017 AFL Grand Final broadcast featured a high frequency and extensive duration of unhealthy marketing, especially for unhealthy food and sugary drink brands.

Sergio,A Point Difference Analysis Established by Winners and Losers in International Badminton Doubles Matches,"The aim of this study is to analyze the point difference established in three different phases between winners and losers in international men’s and women’s badminton doubles matches. Analyzing 183 matches from the 2021 TotalEnergies World Championship, each match was divided into three phases: Phase 1 (0-7 points), Phase 2 (8-14 points), and Phase 3 (15-21 points). Maximum Point Difference (MPD) and Maximum Consecutive Points (MCP) were examined to assess player performance. Kruskal-Wallis H and Mann-Whitney U statistical tests were conducted. Significant differences between winners and losers were found in all phases, with the difference increasing significantly over phases with medium to large effect sizes. The first seven points significantly increase a player’s chances of winning. 72% (men’s category) and 75% (women’s category) of players won, who was ahead in the point difference in the first phase of the game. In the men’s category, 67.4% won who were ahead in point difference in all three phases. Whereas in the women’s category, it is 70.45%. Winners in both categories had significantly (p<0.05) higher consecutive points than the losers. In the second phase, the winners averaged 5 to 6 points over the losers in both categories. The winners kept increasing their point difference in every phase. On the other hand, in losers, the point difference decreased throughout the game. These findings underscore the importance of early lead acquisition and suggest potential strategies and tactics to enhance players’ winning probabilities. © 2024 Montenegrin Sports Academy.

,Forecasting binary outcomes in soccer,"Several studies deal with the development of advanced statistical methods for predicting football match results. These predictions are then used to construct profitable betting strategies. Even if the most popular bets are based on whether one expects that a team will win, lose, or draw in the next game, nowadays a variety of other outcomes are available for betting purposes. While some of these events are binary in nature (e.g. the red cards occurrence), others can be seen as binary outcomes. In this paper we propose a simple framework, based on score-driven models, able to obtain accurate forecasts for binary outcomes in soccer matches. To show the usefulness of the proposed statistical approach, two experiments to the English Premier League and to the Italian Serie A are provided for predicting red cards occurrence, Under/Over and Goal/No Goal events. © 2021, The Author(s).",10.1007/s10479-021-04224-8,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85112275230&doi=10.1007%2fs10479-021-04224-8&partnerID=40&md5=a4c3a14c9511548d8c8dc31abafaaa02,SCOPUS,Si,Predice el outcome de variables binarias (sí o no ),Accuracy,"Generalized Linear Model, Naïve Bayes",Fútbol,"premiere league, Serie A",masculino,No,Transformación a variables binarias,13 temporadas de premier y serie A,"Tarjeta roja, gol/no gol, Under/over",público,football-data.co.uk,Predecir la ocurrencia de eventos binarios en partidos de fútbol y evaluar su impacto en estrategias de apuestas,Binary value prediction,"Predicción de Red Cards:

Sergio,"Ultimate full contact: Fight outcome characterization concerning their methods, occurrence times and technical–tactical developments","Fight analysis produces relevant technical–tactical information. However, this knowledge is limited in hybrid full-contact combat sports. Therefore, this study aimed to characterize the results of the fights’ outcomes through the winners at the World Ultimate Full Contact (WUFC) Championships between 2008 and 2017. Methods: 170 combats between senior male fighters (master class) from 38 countries were observed; all fight outcome methods, their occurrence times, inherent skills and their development forms were analyzed through frequencies, percentages, crosstabs and chi-square test, considering a Fisher’s exact value of p < 0.05. The fight outcome methods were, in decreasing order, as follows: submission; decision and technical knockout (TKO); knockout (KO); and doctor stoppage. Only 19.4% fights completed the regular time 10 min (600 s), and 68.8% fight outcomes occurred in the first 5 min (300 s). Chokes were more used than joint locks, primarily developed in single actions. Head punches and kicks were the skills most responsible for KO, developed more in combinations and counter-attacks, while TKO was always through combination attacks and mostly by ground and pound. Ground fighting is most effective. In stand-up fighting, combination attacks and counter-attack are most effective. It is important to increase the technical–tactical capacities and adjustable decision-making to perform the regular fight time. © 2020 by the authors.

,A predictive analytics framework for forecasting soccer match outcomes using machine learning models,"Predicting the outcome of a sports game is a favourite pastime for sports fans and researchers. The interest has intensified in recent years due to data availability, the development and successful implementation of machine learning algorithms, and the proliferation of internet gaming. This research focuses on developing a predictive analytics framework using machine learning or artificial intelligence models, as well as publicly available game results and weather data, to accurately predict outcomes of games in the English Premier League. Development efforts include experimentation using weather data and constructs such as fatigue and momentum.

Sergio,Framing effects and the market selection hypothesis: Evidence from real-world isomorphic bets,"We collect data on 75 million GBP of tennis bets over a 6 year period to analyze whether participants in high-stakes environments recognize simple framing differences. The structure of this market means that we can place the same bet at the same time in two different ways. These two isomorphic bets are framed differently, and often priced differently. We find that bettors make frequent mistakes, choosing the worse of the two bets in 35% of cases. However, bettors who choose the inferior price earn higher returns from their bets, suggesting that their effort has been focused on fundamental information acquisition rather than bet execution. The net result is that market selection may, if anything, slightly favor those who are unable, or unwilling, to recognize framing differences. © 2021 The Southern Economic Association.",10.1002/soej.12519,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85107328250&doi=10.1002%2fsoej.12519&partnerID=40&md5=cb28e37b903e41cd852d65bc09930e9b,SCOPUS,No,No termino de ver como podemos relacionarlo con el tema del proyecto,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sergio,Time–motion analysis by playing positions of male handball players during the european championship 2020,"The aim of this study was to analyze time–motion characteristics of elite male handball players during the last European Championship 2020. A total of 414 players from 24 national teams were analyzed during 65 matches using a local positioning system (LPS) for the first time in a European Championship. Players (n = 1865) covered significantly (p < 0.001; ES = 0.48) more total distance in offense (1217.48 ± 699.33 m) and in all locomotion categories (p < 0.001) than in defense (900.96 ± 538.95 m), with a similar average total time on court (13.40 ± 8.19 min in offense and 13.27 ± 8.59 min; p > 0.05). The running pace was significantly higher in offense 96.53 ± 22.57 m/min than in defense 82.72 ± 43.28 m/min (p < 0.001; ES = 0.47). By playing positions, the Left Wing players covered significantly (p < 0.001) higher distances (2547.14 ± 1309.52) and showed longer playing time (32.08 ± 17.01). Center Back was the playing position that showed the highest global running pace (98.34 m/min). Players with higher running pace in offense (p < 0.001) were Left Backs (105.95 ± 25.20) and the Center Backs in defense (95.76 ± 48.90). There were no significant differences between winners and losers or between top ranked and lower ranked teams in terms of time played, distance covered, and running pace.

Sergio,What variables can differentiate winning and losing teams in the group and final stages of the 2018 FIFA World Cup?,"To compare the tactical, physical and technical indicators between winners and losers of the group and final stages of the 2018 FIFA World Cup (WC). Eighteen variables were analysed, divided into tactical (ball possession), physical (distance covered, sprints and intensity zones 1 [low] to 5 [high]) and technical indicators (passing, shots and corners). The losing teams had lower ball possession in the group stage when compared to the winners (p = .04). There was a tendency (p = .06) for winners to spend more time in high intensity (group stage). Winners also had a tendency towards greater passing success (p = .06), shots (p = .05) and shots on target (p < .01). In summary, the winning teams have greater ball possession and pass success during the group stage of the 2018 FIFA WC, in addition to spending more time at high intensities and achieving more shots and shots on target independent of whether the match was performed in the group or final knockout stage. Our findings do not suggest any additional physical, tactical or technical variable in the determination of success in high-level soccer competition. © 2019, © 2019 Cardiff Metropolitan University.",10.1080/24748668.2019.1593096,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85063692701&doi=10.1080%2f24748668.2019.1593096&partnerID=40&md5=84c8d41259c60043349a4ff84d9a0560,SCOPUS,No,Otro de estadística que no llega a ningún lado,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Machine learning in football betting: Prediction of match results based on player characteristics,"In recent times, football (soccer) has aroused an increasing amount of attention across continents and entered unexpected dimensions. In this course, the number of bookmakers, who offer the opportunity to bet on the outcome of football games, expanded enormously, which was further strengthened by the development of the world wide web. In this context, one could generate positive returns over time by betting based on a strategy which successfully identifies overvalued a betting odds. Due to the large number of matches around the globe, football matches in particular have great potential for such a betting strategy. This paper utilizes machine learning to forecast the outcome of football games based on match and player attributes. A simulation study which includes all matches of the five greatest European football leagues and the corresponding second leagues between 2006 and 2018 revealed that an ensemble strategy achieves statistically and economically significant returns of 1.58% per match. Furthermore, the combination of different machine learning algorithms could neither be outperformed by the individual machine learning approaches nor by a linear regression model or naive betting strategies, such as always betting on the victory of the home team. © 2019 by the authors.",10.3390/app10010046,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85079219903&doi=10.3390%2fapp10010046&partnerID=40&md5=dca665cffcb1eeff14bd18f0b67f0781,SCOPUS,Si,"I mean, machine learning y predicción de resultados de partidos",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sergio,Football Clubs and the Global Transfer Market,"This is the first book to examine labour markets in professional football from the perspective of football clubs rather than players. Drawing on data from the eight biggest European football leagues - the hub of the global player transfer market - the book explores how and why clubs scout the market for new players, why they let players go, and how they use their academies to identify and develop young talent. Arguing that clubs aren’t fully rational actors when it comes to player transfers and talent development, it demonstrates that clubs’ talent policy is most often a bet on high player turnover alongside local recruitment. It shows that most transfers take place domestically between clubs within country borders, using sociological analysis to explore the investment of clubs in domestic labour markets, and offers new insight into the internal operation of clubs in the way that they manage their first team squads and youth academies, and how this often creates conditions of anxiety and insecurity that isn’t in the best interests of clubs or players. International in scope, and shining new light on sports labour markets and organisational behaviour in sport, this book is fascinating reading for any advanced student, researcher, policy-maker or practitioner with an interest in sport business and management, talent identification and development, or international business or human resource management. © 2025 Thijs A.

Sergio,Changes in Satisfaction with Meaningful Activities and Onset of Depressive Symptoms among Community-Dwelling Japanese Older Adults: A Population-Based Study Before and During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Objectives: This study aimed to clarify the association between changes in satisfaction with meaningful activities and the occurrence of depressive symptoms before and during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Design: A population-based prospective cohort study (Tarumizu Study). Setting and Participants: A total of 231 community-dwelling older adults aged ≥65 years without depressive symptoms at baseline. Methods: The participants completed baseline (June to December 2018, before the COVID-19 pandemic) and follow-up (September to December 2021, during the COVID-19 pandemic) assessments. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15) and defined by a GDS-15 score of ≥5. Participants selected meaningful activities from the 95 activities included in the Aid for Decision-Making in Occupation Choice, and their satisfaction levels were evaluated. Satisfaction with the most meaningful activities was assessed as to whether it was maintained/improved or decreased at follow-up. Results: In the follow-up survey, 31 (14.3%) participants reported the occurrence of depressive symptoms. Compared with before the COVID-19 pandemic, the rates of meaningful activities during the COVID-19 pandemic decreased for interpersonal interaction and social life and increased for leisure, sports, self-care, and domestic life. Logistic regression analysis revealed that changes in satisfaction with meaningful activity were associated with the occurrence of depressive symptoms after adjusting for demographic variables, baseline GDS scores, cognitive and physical status, and instrumental activities of daily living (odds ratio, 2.78; 95% confidence interval, 1.17–6.59, P = .020). Conclusions and Implications: To avoid decreasing satisfaction with meaningful activities, supporting older adults may be protective against the occurrence of depressive symptoms. Our findings highlight the need for health care professionals to not only encourage older adults to participate in activities for their mental health but also consider whether the activities are meaningful or satisfying for them. © 2023 AMDA – The Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine",10.1016/j.jamda.2023.03.010,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85152739663&doi=10.1016%2fj.jamda.2023.03.010&partnerID=40&md5=c1b57b20d0aea31a68884b315f876092,SCOPUS,No,Estudio de la pandemia de Covid-19 en Japón,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sergio,Forbidden actions in World Judo Championships: differences between winner and non-winner athletes; [Ações proibidas em campeonatos mundiais de judô: diferenças entre atletas vencedores e não vencedores]; [Acciones prohibidas en campeonatos mundiales de judo: diferencias entre atletas ganadores y no ganadores Resumen],"Penalties in judo result from negative actions that are not in line with judo combat regulations. The aim of the research was to determine the differences in penalties between winner and non-winner competitors in judo. A total of 1799 (men=1133 and women=666) matches with penalties were evaluated during 2017, 2018 and 2019 World Judo Championships. The variables were expressed as proportions and compared with the Chi-Square test with pairwise Z-tests. The ratio of receiving the first and second shido was the same in men and women athletes (p>.05), but it was different for weight categories (p<.05). The ratio of shido penalty was different between winner and non-winner athletes, the ratio of the second shido was lower in winner athletes (p<.05). While the ratio of forbidden action was the same in winner and non-winner athletes (p>.05), the ratio of forbidden actions in the first and second shido differed (p<.05). The difference in the penalty ratios in winner and non-winner athletes, especially the difference in forbidden actions leading to first and second shido may reflect some tactical differences. The results of this research can significantly contribute to the understanding of the significance of judo penalties both in training and in competition, as well as to the further study of judo penalties. © 2021 Universidad de León.",10.18002/rama.v16i1.6865,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85123352074&doi=10.18002%2frama.v16i1.6865&partnerID=40&md5=f36672affaabc55ee6562cfacbb91664,SCOPUS,No,"Diferencias entre judokas ganadores y no ganadores, además de técnicas prohibidas (que es esto, inazuma eleven¿)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sergio,Anti-tanking pair matching before an elimination phase of a two-phase tournament,"Perverse incentives are ubiquitous in different economic settings. In sports, they often take the form of temptation to deliberately lose matches (the phenomenon known as tanking or sandbagging). In practice, there were even such pathological situations as when a soccer team intentionally scored an own goal. We show how and when the temptation is generated by the current pair matching method, the one applied after the first phase of many popular tournaments, including the most prestigious soccer championships. If the organizers of important sporting contests do not introduce any organizational innovations, they risk serious match-fixing scandals. We introduce an alternative procedure and show that its practical implementation could radically mitigate the risk. We perform a comparative analysis of the methods. We analyze the format “Winners and Runners-up Advancing from Two Adjacent Groups”, particularly its FIFA World Cup variant. In order to quantify the benefits of switching from the current method to the proposed one, we refer to simulation results. The expected decrease in temptation probability is about 83% and could be even about 90% if we additionally implement the suggested scheduling innovation. © 2020 by the author.

Sergio,Odds-wise view: Whose ideas prevail in the global integrity campaigns against match-fixing?,"The global expansion of sports betting has resulted in the formation of (inter)national governing regimes aimed at sustaining revenue and regulating attendant issues, including match-fixing. This article explores the workings of these regimes vis-a-vis the management of match-fixing issues in sport. More particularly, this article focuses on betting monitoring programmes as countermeasures against match-fixing and conceptualises these as social instruments that ultimately define issues and influence the wider integrity agenda of anti-match-fixing campaigns. Analysing documentary, observation and interview data from two disparate monitoring programmes, the results show that betting monitoring is a technical extension of corporate risk management, invariably reflecting the business interests of the betting industry. Therefore, the operating logic of betting monitoring defines match-fixing as an act of sabotaging the competitive edge of betting companies. Moreover, this interest-laden paradigm reigns within the broader policy agenda of sport integrity by equating the betting industry's interest with that of sport. From this, the article suggests that betting monitoring plays a part in the legitimation of commercial gambling by reframing the issue of match-fixing as a common enemy that gambling and sport join forces to combat, not a risk that gambling brings to sport.",10.1177/10126902211045681,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/10126902211045681,WOS,No,Otro más de amaños deportivos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The data used in this paper is provided by problem D in 2020 ICM, which made up a native soccer team named ’the Huskies’.We perform network analysis on the passing-ball network to identify dyadic and triadic configurations. We further determine that the best formation for the Huskies is the ‘4-3-3‘ formation and the most suitable lineup is D4, D5, D6, D9, M1, M3, M5, F2, F3, F6, which contains two dyadic configurations and one triadic configuration.We present a linear model containing 11 indicators extracted from the data and use it to measure the effectiveness of teamwork. To determine the coefficient of each indicator, we use multiple linear regression to fit the difference of scores of the two sides in each game. By comparing the fitted values with the real values and performing a sensitivity test, we verify the accuracy and stability of our model.By analyzing macro data and comparing the indicators of the winner and the loser of each game, we advise the Huskies’ coaches on psychological construction, coaching team and team structure, etc to improve the Huskies’ performance next season.Finally, we generalize our findings above and provided suggestions on designing effective teams, which are selecting the right members, creating smooth communication networks, etc. We also propose a few new aspects that are not included in my models but are of great importance in evaluating team performance.",10.1109/ICCSE49874.2020.9202386,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9202386,IEEE,No,Busca la mejor formación de un equipo de fútbol para conseguir el mayor rendimiento ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,Conservative Betting on Sport Games with Intuitionistic Fuzzy Described Uncertainty,"The paper discusses rational conservative betting on sport game events by a fuzzy (partially rational) decision maker with the help of generalized lotteries of II type. The scheme accounts for the interval character of probability elicitation results, which may be conveniently described by intuitionistic fuzzy sets. A model of a lottery with intuitionistic fuzzy representation of the state uncertainty is proposed, called fuzzy rational lottery. Utility theory is not directly applicable to that type of lotteries, which is why two transformations into ordinary lotteries are proposed - classical and conservative. The classical set-up uses point estimates of the probability uncertainty intervals to construct lotteries, whereas the conservative set-up is a combination of Wald's maximin principle and utility theory under risk. Those approaches are applied to analyze a hypothetical betting situation over the results of soccer game.

Sergio,eSport: a state-of-the-art review based on bibliometric analysis,"Introduction: eSports is a recent phenomenon that has been garnering interest, mostly among young people. At first, electronic games (which today make up eSports) were considered simply a game, a pastime close to the concept of leisure. Given the dizzying growth of this industry and the emergence of championships with a significant audience, however, eSports began to be related to Sports, besides the possible ‘sporting’ processes present therein. Currently, eSport comprises a set of activities in which people participate, train and develop mental and physical skills through information or communication technologies. Despite this, the impacts of this phenomenon are little explored by scientific literature. Objective: This study seeks to develop a co-word analysis of the eSports research field to highlight the topics addressed in the 21st century. Methods: This bibliometric research analyzed 246 articles retrieved from the Web of Science (Thomson Reuters, New York, USA) database. Letters, editorials, book reviews, conference abstracts/papers, and news were excluded. Discovery and analysis of the main research topics in eSports was performed using the SciMAT software tool. Results & Discussion: Since eSports is a recent phenomenon, the field covers several research topics such as sport, video-game, play, game, motivations and gambling. Academic interest and publications on eSports increased significantly only since 2016, with a significant number of studies within humanities. Conclusion: Despite the few studies, eSports is not just a research topic, but an area of knowledge that encompasses several themes from different areas. In fact, it is a modern human phenomenon that uses information or communication technologies. © JPES.",10.7752/jpes.2021.06480,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85123373421&doi=10.7752%2fjpes.2021.06480&partnerID=40&md5=26b9419e5f8ee98d01465f9683bc1285,SCOPUS,Podría Ser,Tal vez comparativa entre deportes tradicionales y E-Sports aunque meh,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This unpredictability contributes significantly to the enjoyment of sports and has attracted interest from bookmakers, bettors, and fans. With the increased availability of sports-related data and online sports betting, interest in match result prediction has surged. Our study focuses on football (Polish Ekstraklasa), but unlike most studies, we do not aim to predict future outcomes.

,A Bayesian In-Play Prediction Model for Association Football Outcomes,"Point process models have made a significant contribution to the prediction of football association outcomes. It is conventionally the case that defence and attack capabilities have been assumed to be constant during a match and estimated against the average performance of all other teams in history. Drawing upon a Bayesian method, this paper proposes a dynamic strength model which relaxes assumption of the constant teams' strengths and permits applying in-match performance information to calibrate them. An empirical study demonstrates that although the Bayesian model fails to achieve improvement in goal difference prediction, it registers clear achievements with regard to the prediction of the total number of goals and Win/Draw/Loss outcome prediction. When the Bayesian model bets against the SBOBet bookmaker, one of the most popular gaming companies among Asian handicaps fans, whose odds data were obtained from both the Win/Draw/Loss market and over-under market, it may obtain positive returns; this clearly contrasts with the process model with constant strengths, which fails to win money from the bookmaker.",10.3390/app10082904,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/app10082904,WOS,Si,Predicciones con factores dinámincos podría estar bien,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sergio,‘Dis Football Sef … Na Wahala’: A Continental Contest That Troubled a Nation,"Football frequently evokes emotions across ethnic fissures and could threaten national peace. In 1977, at the semi-final stage of the Africa Cup Winners’ Cup, Enugu Rangers supported by Igbos in the Eastern part of the country confronted Shooting Stars of Ibadan, the most popular club among the Yorubas in Western Nigeria. After the first leg of the two-legged encounter ended 0-0 in Lagos, a heated debate emerged about the location for the final leg. There was controversy over which of the clubs’ players should be released from the national team camp for the match. A crowded football calendar emerged with the national team involved in a contest for a place at the 1978 World Cup finals. This paper employs historical method to analyze content from three newspapers–Daily Star in Enugu, Nigerian Tribune in Ibadan, and the New Nigerian in Kaduna. Using the instrumentalist theory of ethnicity, it reveals how both teams sought to gain support but came close to causing ethnic turmoil that was extinguished by intervention of the military leadership who ordered the second leg moved out of Lagos. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",10.1080/09523367.2024.2395329,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85208071762&doi=10.1080%2f09523367.2024.2395329&partnerID=40&md5=53906c41e0938a81a8c58e8c91390844,SCOPUS,No,Rollos sociopolíticos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,On Predicting Soccer Outcomes in the Greek League Using Machine Learning,"The global expansion of the sports betting industry has brought the prediction of outcomes of sport events into the foreground of scientific research. In this work, soccer outcome prediction methods are evaluated, focusing on the Greek Super League. Data analysis, including data cleaning, Sequential Forward Selection (SFS), feature engineering methods and data augmentation is conducted. The most important features are used to train five machine learning models: k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN), LogitBoost (LB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF) and CatBoost (CB). For comparative reasons, the best model is also tested on the English Premier League and the Dutch Eredivisie, exploiting data statistics from six seasons from 2014 to 2020. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) and transfer learning are also tested by encoding tabular data to images, using 10-fold cross-validation, after applying grid and randomized hyperparameter tuning: DenseNet201, InceptionV3, MobileNetV2 and ResNet101V2.

Sergio,Big Data Analysis of Nadal's Winning Factors in Men's Singles Final of 2020 French Open,"Objective: This paper is to explore the winning factors of Nadal in the men's singles final of 2020 French Open. Methods: Statistics of Djokovic and Nadal's game video, and analysis of the relevant data. Results: Nadal has more aces and less double faults than Djokovic. The first serve percentage is almost the same, but Nadal's win on first serve and win on second serve is higher than Djokovic's. The max serving speed is the same. The first serve average speed and second serve is the same. Nadal's receiving points won is higher than Djokovic's. In AD Court, Djokovic's first and second serve are mainly in the middle. In Deuce Court, Djokovic's first and second serve are mainly in the wide. In AD court, Nadal's first and second serve are mainly in the wide. In Deuce Court, Nadal's first and second serve are mainly in the middle. Nadal is twice more than Djokovic in short rallies points, less than Djokovic in medium rallies points, and more than Djokovic in long rallies points and total points won. Nadal is less than Djokovic in total winners, but higher than Djokovic in winners' height above ground, higher than Djokovic in winners' average spin, and the fastest winners speed is almost the same. Djokovic and Nadal's winners are mainly located near the two singles sidelines in the middle and back court. Nadal's winners are closer to the bottom line. Conclusion: In 2020 French Open Men's singles final, Nadal's winning factors are as follows: higher win on serve; higher receiving points won; higher stability in stalemate; trickier hitting point (closer to the sideline of middle and back court singles). © 2021 IEEE.",10.1109/TCS52929.2021.00087,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85116069076&doi=10.1109%2fTCS52929.2021.00087&partnerID=40&md5=0cdf4d4c7aab2019a94ea1e2910a7928,SCOPUS,No,Está centrado más bien en análisis de rendimiento deportivo (el de don Rafael Nadal Parera),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sergio,The Right-Oriented Bias in Soccer Penalty Shootouts,"Previous studies suggest that approach motivation (a focus on achieving positive outcomes) is related to relative left-hemispheric brain activation, which results in a variety of right-oriented behavioral biases. It has been argued that during FIFA World Cup penalty shootouts, soccer goalkeepers whose team was behind and therefore had approach motivation, dived right more often than left. The present study elaborates on the previous studies in several ways. First, we collected a larger dataset with more penalty kicks from penalty shootouts in top worldwide competitions. Second, we analyze several issues about the behavior of kickers and goalkeepers that were not analyzed before. Third, we use a different methodology to determine the direction of the kicks (right, middle or left), which does not rely on subjective perception of human judges for this classification. Our analysis shows no statistically significant relationship between the game situation (which team leads in the shootout) and the goalie's side choice. Kickers showed a small tendency to shoot to the right side of goalkeepers. Goalkeepers whose team was behind were much more likely to dive right than left, which makes sense given the kickers' behavior.",10.1016/j.socec.2020.101546,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socec.2020.101546,WOS,No,"Meh, habla sobre la tendencia de los porteros a tirarse a la derecha en los penaltis cuando su equipo va perdiendo ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sergio,"“Get a £10 Free Bet Every Week!”—Gambling Advertising on Twitter: Volume, Content, Followers, Engagement, and Regulatory Compliance","The internet raises substantial challenges for policy makers in regulating gambling harm. The proliferation of gambling advertising on Twitter is one such challenge. However, the sheer scale renders it extremely difficult to investigate using conventional techniques. In this article, the authors present three U.K. Twitter gambling advertising studies using both big data analytics and manual content analysis to explore the volume and content of gambling ads, the age and engagement of followers, and compliance with U.K. advertising regulations. They analyze 890,000 organic ads from 417 accounts along with data on 620,000 followers and 457,000 engagements (replies and retweets). They find that approximately 41,000 U.K. children follow Twitter gambling accounts, and that two-thirds of gambling advertising tweets fail to fully comply with regulations. Ads for e-sports gambling are markedly different from those for traditional gambling (such as on soccer, casinos, and lotteries) and appear to have strong appeal for children, with 28% of engagements with e-sports gambling ads coming from users under 16 years old. The authors make six policy recommendations: spotlight e-sports gambling advertising, create new social media–specific regulations, revise regulation on content appealing to children, use technology to block users under 18 years from seeing gambling ads, require ad labeling of organic gambling tweets, and deploy better enforcement. © The Author(s) 2021.",10.1177/0743915621999674,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85104320918&doi=10.1177%2f0743915621999674&partnerID=40&md5=af73df117ff90d7a8ccc0ca319893bc7,SCOPUS,No,Anuncios de ludopatía en Twitter (lol),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sergio,"To play or not to play? An analysis of dispositions, gambling, and daily fantasy sport","Following a mega-advertising blitz in the late summer of 2015, daily fantasy sports (DFSs) entered a maturing fantasy sports market as a new, highly accessible, and potentially lucrative alternative to traditional, season-long fantasy sports. The two activities share a name but represent substantially different business models. In the view of some policy makers and state legislatures, DFS appeared to resemble a new form of sports wagering and as a result, several U.S. states banned the activity. The current study examined the consumption behavior differences and gambling-related dispositions of those fantasy participants who play DFS and those who do not. A total of 314 fantasy football participants were surveyed, and the results contribute to what we know about gambling and DFS participation. Although distinct differences were found between the two groups, the overall assessment of the findings suggest DFS participation appears to align more with highly involved traditional, season-long fantasy sports participation than other forms of gambling. © 2019 Human Kinetics, Inc.",10.1123/jsm.2018-0115,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85065968076&doi=10.1123%2fjsm.2018-0115&partnerID=40&md5=b440d799a3c6efc245c0165b181da6b4,SCOPUS,No,Otro artículo del fantasy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sergio,Long rallies and next rally performances in elite men's and women's badminton,"The aim of the present study was twofold: (i) to identify contextual variables associated with the occurrence of long rallies while investigating time-related and technical parameters; and (ii) to identify performance differences between long rallies and the subsequent rally when accounting for match-context and the players' sex. The sample included 60 men's (n = 4,475 rallies) and 60 women's (n = 4,490 rallies) matches randomly selected from the 2015 World Badminton Super Series and World Championship (the final sample included long rallies that had an immediate next point played: n = 1,734 and n = 1,644 rallies for male and female players, respectively). The long rallies represented 19.4% (n = 867) and 16.5% (n = 822) of total rallies for male and female players, respectively. Long rallies were established using a two-step cluster model based on rally time and number of strokes for male (13-79s, 14-72 strokes) and female players (11-56s, 11-52 strokes). The variables collected were point outcome (when serving and receiving, winner, forced-error and unforced-error), number of strokes per rally, rally time, rest time, density, and time between strokes. The rallies were classified into different contexts (clusters) according to influencing factors with eight clusters for male players and three clusters for female players identified. Comparisons among clusters were conducted using Kruskal Wallis and one-way ANOVAs. Comparisons between long and immediate next points were conducted using the Wilcoxon tests for most variables and Crosstabs Command for point outcome and rallies (long and immediate next). Statistically significant differences were identified for both sexes among clusters only for time-related variables (i.e., rally time, rest time, density and time between strokes). In addition, a greater number of strokes, longer rally, rest time, and higher density were identified during long rallies compared with the immediate next rally for both men's and women's matches (p<0.05). The time between strokes during long rallies was significantly greater for male players during clusters 3, 5, 6, and 7 (p<0.05) and significantly lower for female players during all clusters (p<0.05). Significant relationships were identified between winning point outcome, and more unforced errors when serving during the immediate next rally (men's cluster 5 and women's cluster 2), and more winners when serving during the immediate next rally (men's cluster 6). The current study identified and characterised long rallies in elite men s and womeńs badminton matches highlighting the importance of sex and contextual factors on time-related and technical demands. Information obtained from these unique sequences of play (i.e., long and immediate next rallies) will assist coaches when modelling and simulating players' performances (i.e., physiologically and cognitively) during athlete preparation/competition. © 2020 Gomez et al.",10.1371/journal.pone.0229604,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85081020458&doi=10.1371%2fjournal.pone.0229604&partnerID=40&md5=556794956adb9b8471d33c175b4789d8,SCOPUS,No,Sirve para los entrenadores analizar los rallies largos para poder hacer entrenamientos acordes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,Modeling Tennis Matches Using Monte Carlo Simulations Incorporating Dynamic Parameters,"Although it may seem to be one of the more unpredictable sports, tennis can be rather accurately modelled using the Monte Carlo method. This study aims to evaluate the accuracy of a Monte Carlo simulation that integrates dynamic tennis parameters in forecasting the outcome of a specific match. To predict the outcome of a tennis match, a conventional Monte Carlo simulation based on the identical and independent point distribution assumption requires only two parameters: the probabilities of both players winning a point on their own serve. A more sophisticated method proposed in this paper considers how fatigue affects a player’s performance and it analyses and implements the change in the probability of winning a service point after “breaking” an opponent’s service game. Calculating the relevant statistics required for player profiling was a critical step in this study. Following that, both previously mentioned variations of the Monte Carlo simulation were implemented to compare their performance. Finally, the method was tested on real-world tennis data.",10.23919/MIPRO57284.2023.10159731,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10159731,IEEE,Si,Montecarlo suena bien ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sergio,Analyzing the influence of player tracking statistics on winning basketball teams,"Basketball player tracking and hustle statistics became available since 2013-2014 season from National Basketball Association (NBA), USA. These statistics provided us with more detailed information about the played games. In this paper, we analyze statistically significant differences in these recent statistical categories between winning and losing teams. The main goal is to identify the most significant differences and thus obtain new insight about what it usually may take to be a winner. The analysis is done on three different scales: marking a winner in each game as a winning team, marking teams with 50 or more wins at the end of the season as a winning team, and marking teams with 50 or more wins in a season, but considering only their winning games, as a winning team. The results of the analysis reveal a few categories that are significantly different between the winning and the losing teams, such as: the number of uncontested shots made, the number of assists and secondary assists, and the number of defensive rebound chances. Based on these results, we propose the effective passing ratio, a novel statistical category, which also demonstrates large differences between winning and losing teams.",10.23919/MIPRO.2018.8400276,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8400276,IEEE,Podría Ser,"Bueno, analiza posibles factores que podrían ayudar a decantar sobre qué equipo es más probable de ganar",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sergio,A simple new method for identifying performance characteristics associated with success in elite tennis,"Performance analysis and identifying performance characteristics associated with success are of great importance to players and coaches in any sport. However, while large amounts of data are available within elite tennis, very few players employ an analyst or attempt to exploit the data to enhance their performance; this is partly attributable to the considerable time and complex techniques required to interpret these large datasets. Using data from the 2016 and 2017 French Open tournaments, we tested the agreement between the results of a simple new method for identifying important performance characteristics (the Percentage of matches in which the Winner Outscored the Loser, PWOL) and the results of two standard statistical methods to establish the validity of the simple method. Spearman’s rank-order correlations between the results of the three methods demonstrated excellent agreement, with all methods identifying the same three performance characteristics (points won of 0–4 rally length, baseline points won and first serve points won) as strongly associated with success. Consequently, we propose that the PWOL method is valid for identifying performance characteristics associated with success in tennis, and is therefore a suitable alternative to more complex statistical methods, as it is simpler to calculate, interpret and contextualise. © The Author(s) 2018.",10.1177/1747954118809089,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85058959474&doi=10.1177%2f1747954118809089&partnerID=40&md5=bbd1715474c3bf0ae95b4acb5ba16604,SCOPUS,Podría Ser,Similar al anterior pero en tenis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sergio,Trajectories through temporal networks,"What do football passes and financial transactions have in common? Both are networked walk processes that we can observe, where records take the form of timestamped events that move something tangible from one node to another. Here we propose an approach to analyze this type of data that extracts the actual trajectories taken by the tangible items involved. The main advantage of analyzing the resulting trajectories compared to using, e.g., existing temporal network analysis techniques, is that sequential, temporal, and domain-specific aspects of the process are respected and retained. As a result, the approach lets us produce contextually-relevant insights. Demonstrating the usefulness of this technique, we consider passing play within association football matches (an unweighted process) and e-money transacted within a mobile money system (a weighted process). Proponents and providers of mobile money care to know how these systems are used—using trajectory extraction we find that 73% of e-money was used for stand-alone tasks and only 21.7% of account holders built up substantial savings at some point during a 6-month period. Coaches of football teams and sports analysts are interested in strategies of play that are advantageous. Trajectory extraction allows us to replicate classic results from sports science on data from the 2018 FIFA World Cup. Moreover, we are able to distinguish teams that consistently exhibited complex, multi-player dynamics of play during the 2017–2018 club season using ball passing trajectories, coincidentally identifying the winners of the five most competitive first-tier domestic leagues in Europe. © 2021, The Author(s).",10.1007/s41109-021-00374-7,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85105159449&doi=10.1007%2fs41109-021-00374-7&partnerID=40&md5=240e483394ad187e0646f8fe53bcbb30,SCOPUS,Podría Ser,No tengo muy claro como usar este articulo pero no se ve mal la idea,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Seeding has been based on the FIFA World Ranking released on 31 March 2022 but these three teams have been drawn from the weakest Pot 4. We show that the official seeding policy does not balance the difficulty levels of the groups to the extent possible: a better alternative would have been to assign the placeholders according to the highest-ranked potential winner, similar to the rule used in the UEFA Champions League qualification.

Sergio,Penalties in judo: the impact of shido on match durations and results,"The effects of penalties on match outcomes were investigated in this study. Data were obtained from a total of 5039 matches that included men, women, and all weight categories during the latest two world championships and eight different grand prix tournaments. The effects of shido on losing and factors affecting these penalties were determined with a binary logistic regression analysis. Receiving a shido during the match increased the possibility of losing (Odds ratio (OR)= 1.14). The possibility of defeat of the athletes who received the second shido was higher compared to those who did not (OR= 2.13). The possibility of penalisation with both first shido (OR= 1.86) and second shido (OR= 2.76) of defeated athletes was higher than winners. Each 1-minute increase in match duration increased possibility of receiving a shido (OR= 2.10, for first shido; OR= 1.87 for second shido). Despite current rule changes that aimed to decrease direct effects of penalties on match outcomes to create positive judo, receiving a shido was found to still significantly affect competitors’ techniques and tactics during the match and indirectly affect the match outcomes. Therefore, it is suggested that coaches and especially heavyweight athletes should evaluate the effects of shido on match tactics. © 2020, © 2020 Cardiff Metropolitan University.",10.1080/24748668.2020.1775413,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85087077307&doi=10.1080%2f24748668.2020.1775413&partnerID=40&md5=fdde3e5f6a72f96c6637acf1962c1ee6,SCOPUS,No,"No, no más judo ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sergio,Detection of the technical-tactical pattern of the scoring actions in judo in the men’s category of –73 kg,"The scoring actions determine the judoka winner in a combat. The scientific community has studied them, but these studies are especially descriptive. To this end, the purpose of this study is to discover and analyse the technical-tactical patterns of the scoring actions in judo combat. Ninety-one scoring actions were analysed (−73 kg males, Judo World Championship 2017) using different commonly used analysis techniques within the observational methodology: traditional statistical analysis, T-Patterns detection, sequential analysis delays and polar coordinates analysis. The tendency of scoring with leg and arm projections prevails (seoi-otoshi, ouchi-gari, tai-otoshi and uchi-mata). The more efficient technique on the ground was yoko-shiho-gatame. The waza-ari is three times more frequent than the ippon. The actions score mainly during the final stages of combat. The judokas with favourable scores score more points through immobilisations, with scores equal to leg techniques and with scores against sacrificial techniques. It is important to conduct the combat’s initiative because in most the actions, the judoka that scores has no penalties and the one who does not score does. A common pattern is achieving a waza-ari with a direct leg attack technique or a static arm technique. © 2019, © 2019 Cardiff Metropolitan University.",10.1080/24748668.2019.1655934,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85071020463&doi=10.1080%2f24748668.2019.1655934&partnerID=40&md5=384b4d5c3f600d8c48b84a12965fec80,SCOPUS,No,More judo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sergio,Effects of Core Training in Physical Fitness of Youth Karate Athletes: A Controlled Study Design,"This study aimed to analyse the impact of an 8-week core strength training (CST) programme in youth karate practitioners on core endurance, agility, flexibility, sprinting, jumping, and kick performance. This study followed a randomized parallel design. Twenty-nine participants (age: 12.86 ± 0.81 years old; height: 152.55 ± 10.37 cm; weight: 42.93 ± 8.85 kg) were allocated to a CST programme (n = 16) performed thrice weekly or to a control group (n = 13) only performing the sport-specific (karate) training. Participants were assessed three times (baseline, mid and post-intervention) for the following tests: (i) flexor endurance test (FET); (ii) back extensor test (BET); (iii) lateral musculature test (LMT); (iv) flexibility; (v) chance of direction (COD); (vi) countermovement jump (CMJ); (vii) back muscle strength (BMS); (viii) horizontal jump (LJ); (ix) sprint test; and (x) karate kick test (KKT). Between-group analysis revealed significant advantages for the CST group on the FET (p < 0.001), BET (p < 0.001), LMT (p < 0.001), 20 m sprint (p = 0.021) and KKT for right (p < 0.006) and left (p < 0.020) legs. No significant differences were found between groups in the remaining physical fitness variables (p > 0.05). The within-group changes revealed significant improvements in the CST group at flexibility (p = 0.002), COD (p < 0.001), CMJ (p < 0.001), BMS (p < 0.002), 20 m sprint (p = 0.033), and KKT (p < 0.001). In addition, within-group changes in the control group were also significant in flexibility (p = 0.024) and right kick (p < 0.042). We conclude that the CST programme improves core endurance and karate kick performance; however, it is not effective enough for other physical performance parameters in KR practitioners. © 2022 by the authors.

Sergio,Sports Betting: Expertise or Luck? A Systematic Review of Betting Studies,"One essential element of gambling refers to its outcome that is mainly or completely based on chance. This systematic review focuses on the question of whether sports betting should be classified as a game of chance or alternatively as a game of skill, in which certain competencies of the players play a decisive role in predicting sporting events. A systematic literature search revealed a total of 9 betting studies meeting our inclusion criteria, where different groups of persons bet on the outcomes of real sporting events, either against each other or against chance. Nearly all studies show that knowledge or other skills do not play a significant role in sports betting. This fact applies regardless of the type of sport, the specific sporting event or certain study parameters. Accordingly, sports betting should belong to the category of gambling in both a legal and political sense, and the corresponding measures from the gambling field for player protection and the protection of youth should be implemented. A central aim here is to prevent the development of cognitive biases such as the illusion of control, or the misconception that one's own expertise may help to make money in sports betting.",10.1055/a-1226-7351,http://dx.doi.org/10.1055/a-1226-7351,WOS,No,Que si apostar es algo de suerte o ser un máquina (Mr. Tipster),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sergio,Part of the Game? Exploring the Prevalence and Normalization of Gambling in Belgian Sports Clubs,"Gambling and sports are entangled in a close relationship. However, little remains known about gambling behaviors and perceptions in sports. Drawing on normalization theory, this study explores the prevalence and predictors of problem gambling as well as the normalization of gambling (including its availability and accessibility, prevalence, and socio-cultural accommodation) in sports clubs. A cross-sectional study design was implemented, based on an online survey completed by 817 Belgian sports club actors. This survey consisted of the Problem Gambling Severity Index (PGSI) and questions about personal and socio-cultural factors regarding gambling. Data were analyzed with SPSS 26 software, using descriptive statistics and an ordinal logistic regression analysis. These analyses exposed being male, being aged 26–35 years old, and being involved in football (soccer) as factors that might be linked with higher levels of problem gambling in sports. Furthermore, sports betting is especially shown to be normalized in sports clubs given its prevalence, and its frequently organized and discussed character. Moreover, respondents disclosed a lack of formal rules (96%) and education initiatives (98.7%) on gambling in their sports club. Given the indicated support for gambling regulations and educational measures, this study may inform sports organizations about how to help denormalize gambling. © 2022 by the authors.

Sergio,"Efficiency testing of prediction markets: Martingale approach, likelihood ratio and bayes factor analysis","This paper studies efficient market hypothesis in prediction markets and the results are illustrated for the in-play football betting market using the quoted odds for the English Premier League. Our analysis is based on the martingale property, where the last quoted probability should be the best predictor of the outcome and all previous quotes should be statistically insignificant. We use regression analysis to test for the significance of the previous quotes in both the time setup and the spatial setup based on stopping times, when the quoted probabilities reach certain bounds. The main contribution of this paper is to show how a potentially different distributional opinion based on the violation of the market efficiency can be monetized by optimal trading, where the agent maximizes logarithmic utility function. In particular, the trader can realize a trading profit that corresponds to the likelihood ratio in the situation of one market maker and one market taker, or the Bayes factor in the situation of two or more market takers. © 2021 by the authors.

Sergio,Talent Allocation in European Football Leagues: Why Competitive Imbalance May be optimal?,"Professional sports are part of the entertainment industry; as such, its business is developed based on the perceived interest in sporting events, which in turn depends on features like: the (i) degree of competitive balance that determines the uncertainty of the outcome; the (ii) concentration of gifted players in a team, whose interaction of talents on the field enhances the quality of the ‘product joint’ that is a sporting event; the (iii) joint aggregate quality of rival teams; the (iv) appeal of rivalries associated with fans’ feelings of empathy and loyalty; etc. This paper focusses on the first three points by modelling the success of team-sport competitions as the result of the overall quality, which encompasses more than the mere sum of individual talents. Sport economists and practitioners generally acknowledge that competitive balance must be fostered to protect uncertainty about the outcome and thus achieve greater interest in sport competitions by fans and the media. In this paper, we argue that certain degree of imbalance in allocation of talent between teams may be preferable – rather than a perfect competitive balance – to broaden the interest of fans on the sport events and, thus, maximise economic outcomes. The paper also examines the discrepancies across the main European football leagues in this regard. © 2024 the author(s),",10.1515/jbnst-2023-0104,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85208956861&doi=10.1515%2fjbnst-2023-0104&partnerID=40&md5=532ddc57af0995450571e6340507291a,SCOPUS,No,Analiza por qué el desbalance en la localización del talento puede ser óptima (?¿),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sergio,Comparing football bettors' response to social media marketing differing in bet complexity and account type - An experimental study,"Background and aims: The current study aimed to assess how sports bettors respond to advertised bets on social media and whether this differs dependent upon bet complexity and social media account type. Methods: Employing a 3 × 2 repeated measures design, 145 regular football bettors were recruited to take part in an online study requiring them to rate bets advertised upon social media, providing indications of their likelihood to bet, confidence in the bet and how much they would stake on the bet. Advertised bets differed in terms of complexity (low, medium and high) and each bet was presented separately on both an operator account and an affiliate account. Results: Data analysis highlighted a significant interaction between bet complexity and account type, with bettors rating themselves as being more likely to bet and more confident in bets which were presented on an affiliate account for medium complexity bets but not for low or high complexity bets. Discussion and conclusions: This study provides initial evidence that affiliate marketing of sports betting increases bettor's confidence in certain types of bets. This heightens previously addressed concerns around affiliate marketing, given that affiliates are financially incentivised to attract custom toward gambling operators. Future research should explore risk factors for increased uptake of affiliate marketing, and the impact on gambling behaviour.  © 2020 The Author(s).",10.1556/2006.2020.00056,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85127745841&doi=10.1556%2f2006.2020.00056&partnerID=40&md5=acc465a6b121e74b415437f3f9866e08,SCOPUS,No,Que si anunciar apuestas en las rrss afecta ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Novel component variables can be used to distinguish between winning and losing across match periods in elite Gaelic football,"This study examined whether team performance indicators could be used to differentiate winners from losers across specific match periods in 26 Gaelic football games. A principal component analysis, conducted on either 25 (halves) or 27 (quarters) variables, produced 6 components, which explained 83.5% and 81.0% of the variance for halves and quarters, respectively. Generalised estimating equation models were used to identify derived components which differentiated winners from losers across specific periods. In winning halves, 4 components were significant; midfield counterattacking (p = 0.008), possession (p = 0.001), low press efficiency (p = 0.032) and tackle pressure (p = 0.023). Possession (p = 0.007) and tackle pressure (p = 0.014) contributed significantly more to winning in the second compared to the first half. In winning quarters, 4 components were also significant; midfield counterattacking (p = 0.000), possession (p = 0.000), offensive dead ball efficiency (p = 0.029) and high press efficiency (p = 0.034). High press efficiency (p = 0.000) and midfield counterattacking (p = 0.021) contributed significantly more to winning in quarters 1 and 2, respectively, in comparison to quarter 4. These results can be used by coaches to develop tactical strategies and establish performance targets for specific match periods. © 2020, © 2020 Cardiff Metropolitan University.",10.1080/24748668.2020.1741917,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85082312499&doi=10.1080%2f24748668.2020.1741917&partnerID=40&md5=2295df7331bbfb1a0b59c07f4b957bc0,SCOPUS,Uso de PCA para predecir características que pueden determinar el ganador de un partido,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sergio,"When and How a Judo Contest Ends: Analysis of Scores, Penalties, Rounds and Temporal Units in 2018, 2019 and 2021 World Championships","The main aim of this study was to analyse the relationship between how contests end (scores or penalties), the temporal units and the competition rounds regarding when the contest end in the 2018, 2019 and 2021 Judo World Championships. A total of 2340 contests involving 2244 elite judo athletes (1343 men and 901 women) were analysed. Pearson’s chi-squared (χ2) was implemented to analyse the association between variables, and the standardised residuals were used to analyse its interpretation; the strength of the associations was reported as Cramer’s V. Shapiro–Wilk and Kolmogorov–Smirnov were implemented to test the normality of the length of golden score (GS) sequences, and Kruskal–Wallis was applied for analysing GS sequences by championships. Mann–Whitney U was also implemented if a significant effect was detected. The level of significance was set at 0.05. The results were as follows: (1) Most contests ended before the accomplishment of the regular time (BRT), and they were won by ippon. (2) During BRT, the defeated accumulated more shido than the winner, while the opposite happened in contests finishing at the regular time (FRT). (3) Contests ending in the first and third minutes decreased, while contests ending in the second and fourth minutes increased; a longer length of the GS period was observed for women compared with men. (4) BRT contests were overrepresented in rounds 1 and 2, while extended time contests (EXT) in repechage, semi-final, bronze and final were overrepresented. (5) There were fewer waza-ari than expected during the preliminary rounds and more in the final rounds. The current study reveals cornerstone information that could be used to improve the training programs of elite judo athletes. © 2023 by the authors.",10.3390/app13042395,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85149281168&doi=10.3390%2fapp13042395&partnerID=40&md5=a05d3496e2de279f6826e2c0926fe4b9,SCOPUS,No,Judo otra vez,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sergio,Nurturing national champions? Local content in solar auctions and firm innovation,"Rather than by an invisible hand, many industries are kick-started by a government policy. Despite little robust evidence, local content requirements are increasingly used to incentivize domestic manufacturing if imports are cheaper. To examine the effect of local content, we explore an unintended quasi-policy-experiment. Starting in 2013, the Indian government simultaneously held solar auctions with and without local content, providing an otherwise unobserved counterfactual. We digitize the results from the 41 auctions worth 8.65 billion $ in solar module demand and collect annual revenue and solar patents of the 113 participating firms between 2004–2020. For causal identification, we compare winners of local content with similar open auction winners in a staggered difference-in-difference estimation. While we observe an insignificant increase in the same and the following year after firms win LCR auctions, overall, we find winning local content auctions does not significantly increase firms’ solar patents or sales. We identify three reasons why the policy did not create stronger, lasting effects. First, local content did not create sufficient production to enable learning by doing. Second, local content did not generate enough revenue for re-investment into R&D. Third, local content reduced competition in auctions. The analysis underlines the predicament countries face as open auction winners, despite having won 9 times as much capacity, do not patent much (more). © 2023 The Authors",10.1016/j.enpol.2023.113574,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85159348983&doi=10.1016%2fj.enpol.2023.113574&partnerID=40&md5=3089da1b5a1ac94c9d6419c5a5352e4c,SCOPUS,No,Mercado solar indio,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sergio,MEmoFC: introducing the Multilingual Emotional Football Corpus,"This paper introduces a new corpus of paired football match reports, the Multilingual Emotional Football Corpus, (MEmoFC), which has been manually collected from English, German, and Dutch websites of individual football clubs to investigate the way different emotional states (e.g. happiness for winning and disappointment for losing) are realized in written language. In addition to the reports, it also contains the statistics for the selected matches. MEmoFC is a corpus consisting of comparable subcorpora since the authors of the texts report on the same event from two different perspectives—the winner’s and the loser’s side, and from an arguably more neutral perspective in tied matches. We demonstrate how the corpus can be used to investigate the influence of affect on the reports through different approaches and illustrate how game outcome influences (1) references to the own team and the opponent, and (2) the use of positive and negative emotion terms in the different languages. The MEmoFC corpus, together with the analyzed aspects of emotional language will open up new approaches for targeted automatic generation of texts. © 2020, The Author(s).",10.1007/s10579-020-09508-2,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85092571069&doi=10.1007%2fs10579-020-09508-2&partnerID=40&md5=93910352c77e22781a6f842227c50d26,SCOPUS,No,Análisis sentimental y NLP,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sergio,Time-motion analysis of the 2017 wrestling world championships,"Purpose: Material: Results: Conclusions: The purpose of this study was to determine the relative contribution of energy systems in a freestyle (FS) and a Greco-Roman (GR) wrestling match, quantity and quality of obtained scores, and the competition efficiency of winners in the 2017 Wrestling World Championships (WCh) through analysing the recorded videos of all the matches of this event. The materials of the present study were 295 FS and 266 GR recorded videos of the 2017 WCh, a multimedia player (lap top) for watching and analysing them, and a chronometer for recording the different duration of activities happening during these matches. In addition, special papers were designed in advance to make sure that all the required data were recorded properly. The percentages of ATP-PC (ATP), lactic (LAC), and aerobic (AERO) energy systems were 6.66, 62.74, and 30.60 in FS, and 5.94, 67.53, and 26.53 in GR. Quantity and quality analysis of scores showed that FS wrestlers significantly scored more 1-and 4-point, while GR wrestlers were superior regarding the quality 2-point. The average competition efficiency of gold medallists was 18/43±4/67 in FS and 15/87±3/18 in GR which were statistically significantly greater than that of all other placers. This study showed the dominance of LAC in a wrestling match in both styles, although their relative contribution was significantly different between styles. In addition, FS wrestlers significantly scored more points, and Gold medallists demonstrated the greatest average competition efficiency compared to other medallists. © Bahman Mirzaei, Iman Faryabi, Heidar Alizaei Yousefabadi, 2021.",10.15561/26649837.2021.0104,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85102761489&doi=10.15561%2f26649837.2021.0104&partnerID=40&md5=5b219a927f22762a0adfcd8ba3a82817,SCOPUS,No,"Lucha grecorromana, y como conclusión que el que gana la medalla de oro tiene una mejor eficiencia media en el torneo ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sergio,Formation of national volleyball teams: the impact of player migration,"Problem statement: The evolution of team sports is closely tied to the migration of highly skilled players and their concentration in the world's top leagues. Approach: The formation of national volleyball teams is influenced by the migration of leading players to premier international leagues, considering their global rankings. This migration enhances the teams' competitive performance in major international tournaments. Results. The results of the study show that today, there is a migration of volleyball players, members of national teams to the national championships of Italy and Poland, for women in Turkey and Italy, which can be traced to the migration of legionnaires of the national teams of the USA, Serbia, France, and Brazil. It is confirmed that migration processes in volleyball increase after a successful performance at the Olympic Games, manifested in the transition of leading players to the world's major leagues. The analysis of the migration of players of the Olympic Games and World Championships winners shows that a significant increase in migration processes in world volleyball has been observed since 2012 (48.3% for men, 39.2% for women) and will reach its maximum value in 2022 (53.0% and 46.8%, respectively). The analysis of the relationship between migration rates and the ranking based on the results of the 2020 Olympic Games showed a positive correlation (r = 0.587) in the formation of men's national teams and a negative correlation (r =-0.373) in women's teams. There are also strong correlations between migration rates and the country's economic development level, highlighting the significant economic impact of volleyball (r = 0.287 for men, r =-0.368 for women). Conclusions. The analysis of the development of modern volleyball has made it possible to establish that today, its further professionalization is taking place through the formation of professional structures in the Olympic system of competitions. The use of modern international experience in the formation of national teams, considering the factors of globalization, can be used in other team sports. © JPES.",10.7752/jpes.2024.08216,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85203145001&doi=10.7752%2fjpes.2024.08216&partnerID=40&md5=0bb3dc4f1c8029a35c70f6d7afc73e47,SCOPUS,No,Los jugadores emigran de sus paises (es cierto),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sergio,Parking the bus,"This paper explores defensive play in soccer. The analysis is predicated on the assumption that the area of the convex hull formed by the players on a team provides a proxy for defensive style where small areas coincide with a greater defensive focus. With the availability of tracking data, the massive dataset considered in this paper consists of areas of convex hulls, related covariates and shots taken during matches. Whereas the pre-processing of the data is an exercise in data science, the statistical analysis is carried out using linear models. The resultant messages are nuanced but the primary message suggests that an extreme defensive style (defined by a small convex hull) is negatively associated with generating shots. © 2023 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.",10.1515/jqas-2021-0059,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85160855830&doi=10.1515%2fjqas-2021-0059&partnerID=40&md5=c39d938f5fb6e62d45c9f7b49e717b62,SCOPUS,No,JSHJAHSJSHJHAJSHJASJSHJHSJHASH el autobús del FIFA me mato,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sergio,LEARNING FROM SERIAL WINNING COACHES: Caring Determination,"Learning from Serial Winning Coaches provides performance coaches and directors, coach developers, and researchers with the knowledge and tools to affirm and challenge policy and practice and conduct further research to inform future policy and practice in the identification, recruitment, and development of performance coaches. Leading an athlete or team to an Olympic or world championship gold medal or professional league title is a great achievement for a coach; a dream that comes true for a small group of privileged coaches. This outstanding accomplishment can become the defining moment of their careers. Winning multiple golds and championships with different athletes or teams, and across multiple major events spanning decades, is the prerogative of an exclusive club of coaches. This book reveals the secrets, experiences, and practices of 17 of these coaches across 10 sports and 10 different countries. Through a combination of in-depth interviews with the coaches and their athletes and a detailed analysis of their personality and motivational profiles, Mallett and Lara-Bercial offer a unique portrait of the day-to-day workings of these coaches: who they are, how they operate, their leadership style, and their inimitable and often serendipitous journeys to the top of the sporting world. Learning from Serial Winning Coaches goes beyond the description of isolated coaching behaviours provided by previous research to explore the personal realities of these exceptional men and women, coaches, and athletes. The emerging multi-dimensional picture sheds light on the unique conditions and practices that lead to the unparalleled success of these true outliers. This book is key reading for researchers, coaching and coaching psychology students, performance coaches and directors, and coach developers, providing a novel evidence-based theoretical framework to conduct further research, shape and reshape coach development, and facilitate the identification and recruitment of the next generation of serial winners. © 2024 Taylor & Francis.",10.4324/9781003427292,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85174759674&doi=10.4324%2f9781003427292&partnerID=40&md5=98d0d16b2d02fdc2efad437f56c6e272,SCOPUS,No,Un enfoque para entrenadores ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,A Cluster Ensemble Strategy for Asian Handicap Betting,"Football betting has grown rapidly in the past two decades, among which fixed odds betting and Asian handicap betting are the most popular mechanisms. Much previous research work mainly focus on fixed odds betting, however, it is lack of studying on Asian handicap betting. In this paper, we focus on Asian handicap betting and aim to propose an intelligent decision system that can make betting strategy. To achieve this, a cluster ensemble model is presented, which is based on the fact that matches with similar pattern of expected goal trend series may have the same actual outcome. Firstly, we set up the component cluster which classifies matches by the pattern of expected goal trend series and then makes the same betting decision for matches that belong to the same group. Furthermore, we adopt plurality voting approach to integrate component clusters and then determine the final betting strategy. Using this strategy on the big five European football leagues data, it yields a positive return. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",10.1007/978-3-030-26142-9_3,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85072864377&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-030-26142-9_3&partnerID=40&md5=b0f9a76a4687259453f3f5052a32ec6d,SCOPUS,Si,Apuestas para el formato de Hándicap asiático me gusta,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sergio,And the award goes to. . .the Matthew Effect: Examining external status as a predictor of productivity and opportunity,"It has been suggested that increased status that comes from being an award winner can generate enduring advantages that compound over one's career via the Matthew Effect. However, research in this area has yielded conflicting results and has been unable to isolate the unique effect of status on career outcomes from the positive endogenous characteristics of award winners. In the current research, we attempt to address previous research limitations and examine if winning an award is associated with career outcomes (i.e., opportunities and productivity) irrespective of individual productivity levels prior to receiving an award. We examined our research questions using observational data of National Hockey League (NHL) league championship winners and non-winners (N = 427). By using a team award and several different analytic approaches we were able to examine the unique effects of affiliation- based external status, generated from an award win, on career outcomes. Our results generally show support for the Matthew Effect and suggest that affiliation-based external status, achieved by an award win, provides access to increased opportunities, which ultimately results in more productivity. We discuss the importance of incorporating opportunity and investigating its role in the cumulative advantage process and implications of the results. © 2023 Contini, Spence.

Sergio,Comparing competitive balance between genders in team sports,"Research question: Interest in women’s team sports has increased over time. However, there is still little research comparing competitive balance between genders in the bigger sports leagues. Against this background the main research question is whether there are systematic differences in competitive balance between the genders among the bigger sports leagues. Research methods: The analysis involves football (soccer), handball and basketball leagues for the period 2007/08–2016/17 (14 leagues and 135 observations) and is based on quantitative methods. Competitive balance is a multidimensional concept, and this paper separately measures win dispersion, performance persistence and prize (here: championship winner) concentration. Results and findings: In football (soccer), win dispersion is strongly significantly weaker for women’s leagues compared to their respective men’s leagues, while the results for the other dimensions are mixed. Generally, the level of competitive balance seems weak in women’s football (soccer) and in handball. For the latter, there is little difference in competitive balance between the genders. In basketball, the strong significant results for performance persistence suggest that the Women’s National Basketball Association (WNBA) is more balanced than the NBA. Implications: The level of competitive balance in women’s football in Europe looks weak, also compared to the women’s football in North America. If this leads to competitive balance problems (i.e. lower attendance, ceteris paribus) among women’s football in Europe, governing bodies should consider traditional regulations to promote equalization of sporting quality and/or to adjust the framework of the game to better fit women’s physiques. © 2021 The Author(s).

A total of 122 video-recorded matches from two Paralympic Games (i.e., 2012 and 2016) and the 2014 Goalball World Championship were assessed using notational analysis. Individual (n = 2), situational (n = 4), and performance variables (n = 7) were analyzed with good strength of agreement for intra- and interrater kappa index values. Their results showed that penalties play a very important role in the final score, composing around 25% of total goals in elite goalball matches. Winners were awarded on average with 62% of penalties and had 66% effectiveness compared with losers (31% and 53%) or drawers (8% and 52%). Based on the authors' findings, penalty takers should direct their throws at specific target sectors on the court, which could increase their rate of success to over 80%.",10.1123/apaq.2020-0117,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85105813349&doi=10.1123%2fapaq.2020-0117&partnerID=40&md5=9983f54a48d363a3dca560a6fca3f4fe,SCOPUS,No,Factores de como termina un penalti en futbol y efectividad de los tiradores,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Inspired by the contributions of micro-history, the biographical approach and gender studies, the article investigates a “hidden face” of Olympique Lyonnais via the life stories of seven of the club’s female players between 2000 and 2019, and analysis of the local newspaper Le Progrès and the national sports newspaper L’Équipe between 2004 and 2010. Looking back at the conditions of women’s integration into the OL in 2004 and their sporting progression towards excellence, the article shows how the improvement in material conditions for practice, thanks to the commitment of an allied president, fuels both the production of sporting performances and the recognition of athletes. However, this virtuous circle remains, on the one hand, relatively exceptional in the world of women’s soccer in France and, on the other hand, limited, because although they are dominant in the world of women’s soccer, they are nonetheless dominated in the world of professional soccer. Thus, their stories bear witness to the paradoxical status of being privileged in the women’s arena and, at the same time, dominated in the global soccer arena.

,"MVP of the NBA Season Prediction Using Machine Learning, Data Analysis and Web Scraping","People try to anticipate the highest scorers in each season as the NBA (National Basketball Association) becomes more and more popularity for a variety of reasons, including gambling, online tournaments, or competitions. Numerous variables could have an impact on the outcome. The purpose of this article is to develop an effective yet straightforward model to forecast the most valuable player of the current season based on the results of the previous year, as well as to derive team abilities and distinct home advantages based on data from the previous 30 seasons. The model accurately predicts outcomes by looking at some key variables, such as team talent and home field advantage, even when contrasted to the bookmaker's point spread by looking at the games from 1991 to 2022. Even while the data still does not account for additional factors like injuries, fouls, and trades, the forecast produced by this model is still correct. In order to forecast the outcomes, this study uses the ridge regression and random forest regressor models. By comparing the standard errors of the results, the best model is created, and the top player for the upcoming year is determined, resulting in precise projections. © 2024 American Institute of Physics Inc..

,Sports Games Modeling and Prediction using Genetic Programming,"Sports games are largely enjoyed by fans around the globe. Plenty of financial assets, such as betting, need a reference to determine which team is more likely to win. In addition, club coaches and managers can benefit from using a analytical tool that suggests more efficient and suitable strategies to win. Genetic programming is a powerful learning algorithm for prediction and knowledge discovery. In this research, we propose to use genetic programming to model and predict the final outcome of NBA playoffs. We use the regular season performance statistics of each team to predict their final ranks in the Playoffs. Historical data of NBA teams are collected in order to train the predictive models using genetic programming. The preliminary results show that the algorithm is able to achieve a good prediction accuracy, as well as to provide an importance assessment of various performance statistics in determining the probability of winning the final championship.",10.1109/CEC48606.2020.9185917,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9185917,IEEE,Si,"Como no tengo muchos papers, este trata cosas similares a lo que buscamos así que lo leeré con detalle a ver",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE-DRIVEN APPROACH TO IDENTIFY AND RECOMMEND THE WINNER IN A TIED EVENT IN SPORTS SURVEILLANCE,"The proliferation of fractal artificial intelligence (AI)-based decision-making has propelled advances in intelligent computing techniques. Fractal AI-driven decision-making approaches are used to solve a variety of real-world complex problems, especially in uncertain sports surveillance situations. To this end, we present a framework for deciding the winner in a tied sporting event. As a case study, a tied cricket match was investigated, and the issue was addressed with a systematic state-of-the-art approach by considering the team strength in terms of the player score, team score at different intervals, and total team scores (TTSs). The TTSs of teams were compared to recommend the winner. We believe that the proposed idea will help to identify the winner in a tied match, supporting intelligent surveillance systems. In addition, this approach can potentially address many existing issues and future challenges regarding critical decision-making processes in sports. Furthermore, we posit that this work will open new avenues for researchers in fractal AI.",10.1142/S0218348X23401497,http://dx.doi.org/10.1142/S0218348X23401497,WOS,Si,Predicción de partidos igualados en directo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Big ideas in sports analytics and statistical tools for their investigation,"Sports analytics-broadly defined as the pursuit of improvement in athletic performance through the analysis of data-has expanded its footprint both in the professional sports industry and in academia over the past 30 years. In this article, we connect four big ideas that are common across multiple sports: the expected value of a game state, win probability, measures of team strength, and the use of sports betting market data. For each, we explore both the shared similarities and individual idiosyncracies of analytical approaches in each sport. While our focus is on the concepts underlying each type of analysis, any implementation necessarily involves statistical methodologies, computational tools, and data sources. Where appropriate, we outline how data, models, tools, and knowledge of the sport combine to generate actionable insights. We also describe opportunities to share analytical work, but omit an in-depth discussion of individual player evaluation as beyond our scope. This article should serve as a useful overview for anyone becoming interested in the study of sports analytics.This article is categorized under:Applications of Computational Statistics > Education in Computational Statistics",10.1002/wics.1612,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/wics.1612,WOS,Si,Interesante para el análisis de deportes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sergio,The lexicon of soccer(in) between picadito and tiquitaca. Analysis of the intralinguistic subtitling of the Argentine film Metegol,"This paper aims to analyse the original version and the subtitled peninsular Spanish version of the 3D animation feature Metegol (2013) by the Oscar winner and film director Juan Jose Campanella. Considering as a starting point the results achieved in a previous analysis, in which the original version in the Spanish variety of Argentina was compared with the dubbed peninsular Spanish and neutral Spanish versions (De Laurentiis, 2021), the aim of this contribution is to identify how the strategies used in intralinguistic subtitling (Berruto, 2010; Pedersen, 2005) contribute to the achievement of a proper level of sociolinguistic adequacy. Furthermore, the present investigation also considers the function of some relevant elements from different perspectives of variation (diatopic, diaphasic and diastratic), the way these elements are interpreted and perceived by the receiving audience and the distinguishing features of this type of audiovisual translation.",10.13135/1594-378X/6663,http://dx.doi.org/10.13135/1594-378X/6663,WOS,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Betting on Machine Learning: Extracting Patterns from Football’s Anarchic Odds,"The application of machine learning in sports analytics has gained significant attention in recent years, particularly in the domain of football betting. Predictive models, driven by historical data, have the potential to offer deeper insights into match outcomes, providing both bookmakers and bettors with a competitive advantage. This study investigates the use of machine learning algorithms, including Deep Neural Networks (DNN), Decision Trees, and Random Forests, to predict football match results based on historical performance metrics. Emphasis is placed on the role of feature selection and dimensionality reduction techniques, such as Mutual Information (MI) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA), in enhancing model accuracy. The findings contribute to the growing field of sports analytics, offering a framework for improved prediction strategies in football.",10.1109/CommNet63022.2024.10793344,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10793344,IEEE,Si,"Mola, además está en IEEE así que estará muy bien",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sergio,Performance indicators defining goal scoring opportunities in elite asian beach soccer: An artificial neural network approach,"The game of beach soccer at the elite level is characterised with a high tempo that leads to the scoring of many goals in a match. A draw cannot decide the outcome of a match, and thus, a winner is decided by a team that scores more goals than the opponent hence, investigating performance indicators (PIs) that could lead to a higher goal-scoring opportunity in this game is non-trivial in ensuring the success of a team during a match. In the present study, an analysis of performance indicators was carried out through which a total number of 16 relevant performance indicators were considered, and multiple linear regression (MLR) was used to extract the significant PI that could lead to chances of scoring goals. An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) was used to predict the opportunities for scoring goals based on the extracted PIs. The MLR was able to extract shot at back third, pass at front third, short inside box, turnover, tackling, as well as fouls committed as the most significant PI whilst a robust predictive model was obtained via the ANN with an R2 of 0.91 and a very low mean absolute error of 1.76 amongst the other model predictive evaluation parameters. It is postulated from the present study that the identified PIs are essential in increasing the chances of scoring goals in the elite Asian beach soccer competition. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2021.",10.1007/978-981-15-7309-5_27,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85090524613&doi=10.1007%2f978-981-15-7309-5_27&partnerID=40&md5=7f3df1bde984a7431cc3ebb1c1668816,SCOPUS,Podría Ser,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sergio,Forecasting the NBA's Most Valuable Player: A Regression Analysis Approach,"Basketball is immensely popular in the United States, with the National Basketball Association (NBA) recognized as the leading professional league worldwide. Each season, the NBA awards the Most Valuable Player (MVP) title to the player considered the best based on performance statistics and a fair voting process. Predicting the MVP often sparks debates among NBA fans, with various media outlets offering their forecasts. This study aims to accurately predict the MVP by analyzing statistical data from NBA players over a specific period. We employ three different regression algorithms—Decision Tree, Linear Regression, and Support Vector Regression—to compare their effectiveness in MVP prediction.

,Dolores: a model that predicts football match outcomes from all over the world,"The paper describes Dolores, a model designed to predict football match outcomes in one country by observing football matches in multiple other countries. The model is a mixture of two methods: (a) dynamic ratings and (b) Hybrid Bayesian Networks. It was developed as part of the international special issue competition Machine Learning for Soccer. Unlike past academic literature which tends to focus on a single league or tournament, Dolores is trained with a single dataset that incorporates match outcomes, with missing data (as part of the challenge), from 52 football leagues from all over the world. The challenge involved using a single model to predict 206 future match outcomes from 26 different leagues, played from March 31 to April 9 in 2017. Dolores ranked 2nd in the competition with a predictive error 0.94% higher than the top and 116.78% lower than the bottom participants. The paper extends the assessment of the model in terms of profitability against published market odds. Given that the training dataset incorporates a number of challenges as part of the competition, the results suggest that the model generalised well over multiple leagues, divisions, and seasons. Furthermore, while detailed historical performance for each team helps to maximise predictive accuracy, Dolores provides empirical proof that a model can make a good prediction for a match outcome between teams x and y even when the prediction is derived from historical match data that neither x nor y participated in. While this agrees with past studies in football and other sports, this paper extends the empirical evidence to historical training data that does not just include match results from a single competition but contains results spanning different leagues and divisions from 35 different countries. This implies that we can still predict, for example, the outcome of English Premier League matches, based on training data from Japan, New Zealand, Mexico, South Africa, Russia, and other countries in addition to data from the English Premier league. © 2018, The Author(s).",10.1007/s10994-018-5703-7,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85046495672&doi=10.1007%2fs10994-018-5703-7&partnerID=40&md5=3746331b59b29d9953a82073fd2c1f40,SCOPUS,Si,Joder uno de los más similares a lo que buscamos y es el antepenúltimo (me vuelvo loco),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sergio,Next game reaction to mispriced betting lines in college football,"Although studies show the point spread is a very good predictor of actual score differences in college football, there are a number of games each season where the betting line is not close to the actual spread. This article investigates the efficiency of the college football betting market for the game following one with a large difference between betting and actual point spreads for the 2006–2018 seasons. For the entire sample, the simple rule of betting for teams that greatly beat the spread and against teams that did very poorly against the spread in the previous game wins significantly more than half the time. When the results are analysed separately for the better known BCS/Power 5 schools and the lesser known non-BCS/Power 5 schools, efficiency cannot be rejected for games involving the BCS/Power 5 teams. For games involving two non-BCS/Power 5 teams, however, following the betting rule wins against the spread 54.23% of the time, which is significantly greater than 50%. This is consistent with an information gap scenario, where new information is more efficiently incorporated for games involving better-known participants. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",10.1080/13504851.2020.1795063,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088235180&doi=10.1080%2f13504851.2020.1795063&partnerID=40&md5=2c949c3228652b4bf46c063a5b3db331,SCOPUS,Podría Ser,Análisis de rentabilidad de apostar al equipo más probable (54.23% sobre la línea),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sergio,Sweat Loss and Fluid Intake of Female Varsity Ice Hockey Players During On-Ice Practices and Games,"Bigg, JL, Gamble, ASD, Vermeulen, TF, Bigg, LM, and Spriet, LL. Sweat loss and fluid intake of female varsity ice hockey players during on-ice practices and games. J Strength Cond Res 34(2): 389-395, 2020-Sweat losses of similar to 1.5-2% body mass (BM) during exercise impairs athletic performance in stop and go sports such as ice hockey. The study examined the pre-exercise hydration status, sweat loss, fluid and carbohydrate (CHO) intake, and sodium balance of female hockey players. Twenty-four female varsity hockey players were tested during 2 practices and 4 games. Data analyses were performed using a level of significance of p <= 0.05. Over 70% of players arrived at the practices and similar to 50% of players arrived at the game mildly dehydrated. Before the high- (P1) and low-intensity (P2) practices, players consumed an average of 0.19 +/- 0.14 and 0.15 +/- 0.13 L. Before the games, mean fluid intake was 0.39 +/- 0.19 L. The sweat rate during P1 was significantly greater than P2 (p = 0.006), but there was no significant difference in total fluid intake between practices (p = 0.279). Consequently, the average BM loss for P1 was significantly greater than that for P2 (p = 0.016). Sweat loss during games was 1.01 +/- 0.29 L and fluid intake was 0.70 +/- 0.43 L, resulting in minimal BM losses (<1% BM for all players). CHO intake during games was 39.2 +/- 22.8 g, with 19/20 players consuming CHO before or during the intermissions of the game. Sweat sodium losses were 0.64 +/- 0.34 and 0.32 +/- 0.18 g center dot h(-1) for P1 and P2, and 0.83 +/- 0.38 g during the game. In conclusion, female ice hockey players replaced the fluid they lost through sweat during practices and games and maintained adequate hydration. Players also consumed adequate CHO during games from the CHO containing food and drinks provided.",10.1519/JSC.0000000000003351,http://dx.doi.org/10.1519/JSC.0000000000003351,WOS,No,Pérdida de sudor y fluidos de los jugadores de hockey sobre hielo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
