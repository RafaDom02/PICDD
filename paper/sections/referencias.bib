  abstract = {Studies of financial market informational efficiency have proven burdensome in practice, because it is difficult to pinpoint when news breaks and is known by some or all the participants. We overcome this by designing a framework to detect mispricing, test informational efficiency and evaluate the behavioural biases within high-frequency prediction markets. We demonstrate this using betting exchange data for association football, exploiting the moment when the first goal is scored in a match as major news that breaks cleanly. There are pre-match and in-play mispricing and inefficiency in these markets, explained by reverse favourite-longshot bias (favourite bias). The mispricing tends to increase when the major news is a surprise, such as a goal scored by a longshot team late in a match, with the market underestimating their chances of going on to win These results suggest that, even in prediction markets with large crowds of participants trading state-contingent claims, significant informational inefficiency and behavioural biases can be reflected in prices.}

By examining the trends of odds in the event of a major change in expectations about team results, i.e. when the head coach of a team is replaced, we attempt to verify the argument that a profitable strategy for the bettor is likely to be possible. In this case, the market under consideration would be inefficient. Analysing the average effect of head coach replacement, we find a positive impact on team performance. Based on this information, we build a betting strategy to find out whether the bookmakers’ odds absorb this change in expectations about the winning probability of involved teams. Comparing our strategy result with a distribution generated in a Monte Carlo experiment, we conclude that the betting market is inefficient in its semi-strong form.}

  abstract  = {Football betting has grown rapidly in the past two decades, among which fixed odds betting and Asian handicap betting are the most popular mechanisms. Much previous research work mainly focus on fixed odds betting, however, it is lack of studying on Asian handicap betting. In this paper, we focus on Asian handicap betting and aim to propose an intelligent decision system that can make betting strategy. To achieve this, a cluster ensemble model is presented, which is based on the fact that matches with similar pattern of expected goal trend series may have the same actual outcome. Firstly, we set up the component cluster which classifies matches by the pattern of expected goal trend series and then makes the same betting decision for matches that belong to the same group. Furthermore, we adopt plurality voting approach to integrate component clusters and then determine the final betting strategy. Using this strategy on the big five European football leagues data, it yields a positive return.},

  abstract   = {The paper describes Dolores, a model designed to predict football match outcomes in one country by observing football matches in multiple other countries. The model is a mixture of two methods: (a) dynamic ratings and (b) Hybrid Bayesian Networks. It was developed as part of the international special issue competition Machine Learning for Soccer. Unlike past academic literature which tends to focus on a single league or tournament, Dolores is trained with a single dataset that incorporates match outcomes, with missing data (as part of the challenge), from 52 football leagues from all over the world. The challenge involved using a single model to predict 206 future match outcomes from 26 different leagues, played from March 31 to April 9 in 2017. Dolores ranked 2nd in the competition with a predictive error 0.94\% higher than the top and 116.78\% lower than the bottom participants. The paper extends the assessment of the model in terms of profitability against published market odds. Given that the training dataset incorporates a number of challenges as part of the competition, the results suggest that the model generalised well over multiple leagues, divisions, and seasons. Furthermore, while detailed historical performance for each team helps to maximise predictive accuracy, Dolores provides empirical proof that a model can make a good prediction for a match outcome between teams x and y even when the prediction is derived from historical match data that neither x nor y participated in. While this agrees with past studies in football and other sports, this paper extends the empirical evidence to historical training data that does not just include match results from a single competition but contains results spanning different leagues and divisions from 35 different countries. This implies that we can still predict, for example, the outcome of English Premier League matches, based on training data from Japan, New Zealand, Mexico, South Africa, Russia, and other countries in addition to data from the English Premier league.},

In this work, soccer outcome prediction methods are evaluated, focusing on the Greek Super League. Data analysis, including data cleaning, Sequential Forward Selection (SFS), feature engineering methods and data augmentation is conducted. The most important features are used to train five machine learning models: k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN), LogitBoost (LB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF) and CatBoost (CB). For comparative reasons, the best model is also tested on the English Premier League and the Dutch Eredivisie, exploiting data statistics from six seasons from 2014 to 2020. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) and transfer learning are also tested by encoding tabular data to images, using 10-fold cross-validation, after applying grid and randomized hyperparameter tuning: DenseNet201, InceptionV3, MobileNetV2 and ResNet101V2. This is the first time the Greek Super League is investigated in depth, providing important features and comparative performance between several machine and deep learning models, as well as between other leagues. Experimental results in all cases demonstrate that the most accurate prediction model is the CB, reporting 67.73% accuracy, while the Greek Super League is the most predictable league.},

Although predicting football results is a very complex task, the football betting business has grown over time. The unpredictability of football results and the growing betting business justify the development of prediction models to support gamblers. In this article, we develop machine learning methods that take multiple statistics of previous matches and attributes of players from both teams as inputs to predict the outcome of football matches. Several prediction models were tested, with the experimental results showing encouraging performance in terms of the profit margin of football bets.}

Besides, our model has an application in monitoring the betting market, which may be useful to bettors.}

  abstract = {In an economic context, forecasting models are judged in terms not only of accuracy, but also of profitability. The present paper analyses the counterintuitive relationship between accuracy and profitability in probabilistic (sports) forecasts in relation to betting markets. By making use of theoretical considerations, a simulation model, and real-world datasets from three different sports, we demonstrate the possibility of systematically or randomly generating positive betting returns in the absence of a superior model accuracy. The results have methodological implications for sports forecasting and other domains related to betting markets. Betting returns should not be treated as a valid measure of model accuracy, even though they can be regarded as an adequate measure of profitability. Hence, an improved predictive performance might be achieved by carefully considering the roles of both accuracy and profitability when designing models, or, more specifically, when assessing the in-sample fit of data and evaluating out-of-sample forecasting performances.}

  abstract       = {Point process models have made a significant contribution to the prediction of football association outcomes. It is conventionally the case that defence and attack capabilities have been assumed to be constant during a match and estimated against the average performance of all other teams in history. Drawing upon a Bayesian method, this paper proposes a dynamic strength model which relaxes assumption of the constant teams’ strengths and permits applying in-match performance information to calibrate them. An empirical study demonstrates that although the Bayesian model fails to achieve improvement in goal difference prediction, it registers clear achievements with regard to the prediction of the total number of goals and Win/Draw/Loss outcome prediction. When the Bayesian model bets against the SBOBet bookmaker, one of the most popular gaming companies among Asian handicaps fans, whose odds data were obtained from both the Win/Draw/Loss market and over–under market, it may obtain positive returns; this clearly contrasts with the process model with constant strengths, which fails to win money from the bookmaker.},
